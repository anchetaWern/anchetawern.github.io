  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>This article was originally published at Binpress:<br/>http://www.binpress.com/tutorial/getting-started-with-rabbitmq-in-php/164</p></blockquote>


<p>In this tutorial I&rsquo;m going to walk you through how you can use RabbitMQ in PHP. But first what is RabbitMQ? RabbitMQ is a message broker software. It acts as a middleman between a producer and a consumer. Producer being the data that we want to pass, and consumer being the entity that we want to pass it to. RabbitMQ uses a queue, you can think of it as a mailbox where you drop your letters. RabbitMQ then takes the letters and delivers it to its destination.</p>

<h3>Installing RabbitMQ</h3>

<p>In Ubuntu and other debian based operating system you can install RabbitMQ by executing the following commands from your terminal:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>echo "deb http://www.rabbitmq.com/debian/ testing main"  | sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rabbitmq.list &gt; /dev/null
</span><span class='line'>sudo wget http://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-signing-key-public.asc
</span><span class='line'>sudo apt-key add rabbitmq-signing-key-public.asc
</span><span class='line'>sudo apt-get update
</span><span class='line'>sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server -y
</span><span class='line'>sudo service rabbitmq-server start
</span><span class='line'>sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
</span><span class='line'>sudo service rabbitmq-server restart</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What the first command does is to append the rabbitmq source to the software sources list. Next we download the rabbitmq signing key using <code>wget</code>. Then add the key to Ubuntu. Next we call <code>apt-get update</code> to update the software sources list. Next we install the RabbitMQ server, start it then enable RabbitMQ management plugin. This provides an HTTP-based API management for monitoring your RabbitMQ server. Finally we restart the RabbitMQ server so that changes will take effect.
The default username and password is <code>guest</code>. And the default port in which it runs is <code>5672</code>.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re on another operating system, you can find how to install RabbitMQ for your specific operating system here: <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html">Downloading and Installing RabbitMQ</a>.</p>

<h3>Working with RabbitMQ</h3>

<p>Once you&rsquo;re done installing RabbitMQ, we can now install the AMQP library for PHP. This implements the AMQP (Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol) protocol. As the name suggests it is a protocol used for messaging.
Start by creating a new directory, this is where we will put all the files for testing RabbitMQ. Next create a composer.json file and add the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>{
</span><span class='line'>  "require": {
</span><span class='line'>      "videlalvaro/php-amqplib": "2.2.*"
</span><span class='line'>  }
</span><span class='line'>}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, open up your terminal and <code>cd</code> into the directory you created earlier then execute <code>composer install</code> to install the AMQP library.</p>

<p>Before we move on, lets also install <a href="http://swiftmailer.org/">Swiftmailer</a>. You can do that by executing the following command from your terminal. This also adds an entry to Swiftmailer to your composer.json:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>composer require swiftmailer/swiftmailer @stable</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We will be using Swiftmailer for the sample app that were going to create. What we will do is create an app that will send emails for our users. Normally emails takes a few seconds before it is sent, adding an attachment to the email also adds to that time. In the real world we don&rsquo;t really want our users to wait. What we want to do is make them believe that we have already sent the email for them by outputting to the screen that their message has been sent.
This is where RabbitMQ comes in. We will use it as some sort of a mailbox in which multiple users can just drop their messages in. RabbitMQ will then take care of sending the messages in the background.</p>

<h4>Sending Messages</h4>

<p>First lets create the form to be used for sending emails. This will accept the name and email address of the sender, the email address of the receiver and then the subject and message. Name the file <code>form.php</code>:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, create the file which will push the message into the queue. Name the file <code>sender.php</code>.
Require the <code>autoload.php</code> file so that our dependencies will be automatically loaded by PHP. Then use the <code>AMQPConnection</code> and <code>AMQPMessage</code> from the AMQP library. <code>AMQPConnection</code> allows us to create a new connection to the RabbitMQ server and <code>AMQPMessage</code> allows us to create messages that we can push to the queue.</p>

<p>Breaking it down, first we create a new connection by creating a new instance of the <code>AMQPConnection</code> class. This requires the following arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>host</strong> &ndash; the host in which the RabbitMQ server is running. In this case we&rsquo;ve installed RabbitMQ on the same computer we are running the script in. So it should be <code>localhost</code>. Note that in the real world we install RabbitMQ on a another server, different from the one were using to serve our websites. So instead of <code>localhost</code> we use the public ip address of that server.</li>
<li><strong>port</strong> &ndash; the port in which the RabbitMQ server is running.</li>
<li><strong>user</strong> &ndash; the username to use for logging in to the server. By default the username is set to <code>guest</code>.</li>
<li><strong>password</strong> &ndash; the password of the user. By default the password is set to <code>guest</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Next we create a channel. We can do that by calling the <code>channel()</code> method from the connection that we have just declared.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$channel</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$connection</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">channel</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next we declare the queue to be used by calling the  <code>queue_declare</code> method.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$channel</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">queue_declare</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;email_queue&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">false</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">false</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">false</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">false</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>queue_declare</code> method takes up the following arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>queue name</strong> &ndash; a name that you want to use for the queue, you can supply anything for this.</li>
<li><strong>passive</strong> &ndash; a boolean value for specifying whether to check for an existing exchange.</li>
<li><strong>durable</strong> &ndash; a boolean value for specifying whether the RabbitMQ holds on to a queue when the server crashes.</li>
<li><strong>exclusive</strong> &ndash; a boolean value for specifying whether the queue is used by only one connection.</li>
<li><strong>auto-delete</strong> &ndash; a boolean value for specifying whether the queue is deleted when the last subscriber unsubscribes.</li>
</ul>


<p>Next we convert the POST data that we receive from the form to a JSON string. We can only pass strings as a message so we&rsquo;ll have to convert this later on into an array on the receiver&rsquo;s end.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">json_encode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$_POST</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next we create a new message. This accepts 2 arguments: the data and an array of options. For the array of options we specify the <code>delivery_mode</code> to 2 which means that the message is persistent. This means that it isn&rsquo;t lost when the server crashes or an error occurs.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$msg</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">AMQPMessage</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$data</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">array</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;delivery_mode&#39;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">));</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next we publish the message by calling the <code>basic_publish()</code> method on the channel. This accepts 3 arguments: the message, the exchange and the name of the queue. If you&rsquo;re wondering why we set the value of exchange to an empty string, that&rsquo;s because we don&rsquo;t really need it. The exchange is commonly used for pub-sub patterns. What were using here is just basic publish.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$channel</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">basic_publish</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$msg</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;email_queue&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally we just redirect the user to the form.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Receiving Messages</h4>

<p>Breaking it down, the first 5 lines of code are basically the same as the one we have on the <code>sender.php</code> file. Then we just output a message saying how we can stop the file from running. We need to run this file from the terminal so to stop it we just hit <code>CTRL + C</code>.</p>

<p>Next we declare a named function. This will be used for processing the message that we passed from the sender. The first thing it does is output that the message was received. Then we use <code>json_decode()</code> to convert the JSON string back to an array.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$mailer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">Swift_Mailer</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="na">newInstance</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$transporter</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next create a new message, this also takes up the transporter as its argument. We then set the subject, from field, to field, and body of the message.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$message</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">Swift_Message</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="na">newInstance</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$transporter</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">setSubject</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$subject</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">setFrom</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">array</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$from_email</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="nv">$from</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">setTo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">array</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$to_email</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'>        <span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">setBody</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$message</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Finally we send the message and output that the message was sent. The last line basically tells RabbitMQ that the sending of the message has indeed been successful.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$mailer</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">send</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$message</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot; * Message was sent&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">$msg</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">delivery_info</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;channel&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">basic_ack</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$msg</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="na">delivery_info</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;delivery_tag&#39;</span><span class="p">]);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="cp">?&gt;</span><span class="x"></span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Running the program</h4>

<p>You can now run the receiver by going to your terminal and executing the following command:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">php receiver.php</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once its running, go to your browser and access the <code>sender.php</code> file. Enter the details of your message and click on send. You&rsquo;re instantly greeted by a &lsquo;Your message was sent!&rsquo; text but if you immediately check your email account its not there yet. If its not there then the queue is still processing it. Check the output displayed on the terminal window where you executed the receiver. You should see a &lsquo;Message was sent&rsquo; output if the email was already sent.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>RabbitMQ is a nice way for implementing messaging applications such as the one we created in this tutorial. We have barely scratch the surface with this tutorial. I recommend you check out the <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html">getting started guides</a> and the <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html">documentation</a> to learn more.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display</h3>

<p><img src="/images/posts/christmas_wishlist_2014/macbookpro.jpg" alt="macbook pro" /></p>

<p>I have always wanted a Macbook Pro since birth. But due to its priciness I never got myself to buy one.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to stick with the following hardware:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Processor</strong>: 3.0GHz Dual-core Intel Core i7</li>
<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8GB 1600MHz DDR3L SDRAM</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 512GB PCIe-based Flash Storage</li>
</ul>


<h3>Google Nexus 5</h3>

<p><img src="/images/posts/christmas_wishlist_2014/google_nexus5.jpg" alt="Google Nexus 5" /></p>

<p>Not really a Google fanboy, I&rsquo;m just more curious about a smartphone made by Google rather than an Apple&rsquo;s iPhone or Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy.</p>

<h3>PS Vita</h3>

<p><img src="/images/posts/christmas_wishlist_2014/ps_vita.jpg" alt="sony ps vita" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of game consoles from Sony and their games are really good. Here are just some of the titles that I&rsquo;ve enjoyed playing on their PSP game console:</p>

<ul>
<li>Patapon &ndash; that&rsquo;s Patapon 1, 2 and 3</li>
<li>God Eater</li>
<li>Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core</li>
<li>Harvest Moon &ndash; boy &amp; girl, innocent life and hero of the leaf valley</li>
<li>Ratchet and Clank</li>
<li>Naruto Ultimate Ninja Heroes &ndash; that&rsquo;s 1, 2 and 3</li>
<li>GTA: Vice City</li>
<li>Ratchet and Clank</li>
<li>Secret Agent Clank</li>
<li>Valhalla Knights</li>
</ul>


<h3>Nintendo 3ds</h3>

<p><img src="/images/posts/christmas_wishlist_2014/3ds.jpg" alt="Nintendo 3ds" /></p>

<p>To be honest I only really want this game console because of Pokemon. Nintendo 3ds have revolutionize the Pokemon gameplay in this console. There&rsquo;s a bunch of new stuff, and the best thing is that its 3D. So the Pokemon games created for this console won&rsquo;t really look like the Pokemon games created for Nintendo DS or Gameboy.</p>

<h3>Fitbit Flex</h3>

<p><img src="/images/posts/christmas_wishlist_2014/fitbit.jpg" alt="Fitbit" /></p>

<p>Fitbit is an all-in-one tracker for the body. With it you can do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>track steps, distance and calories burned</li>
<li>monitor how long and well you sleep</li>
<li>silent wake alarm</li>
<li>logs food consumption, weight changes</li>
</ul>


<h3>Bose QuietComfort 25</h3>

<p><img src="/images/posts/christmas_wishlist_2014/bose.jpg" alt="Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted a noise cancelling headphones that I can use while working. Based on my research Bose is the best thing out there.</p>

<h3>Olympus ME-52W Noise Canceling Microphone</h3>

<p><img src="/images/posts/christmas_wishlist_2014/olympus_mic.jpg" alt="olympus microphone" /></p>

<p>Screencasting has always been on my TODO list. As a developer I wanted to create a Youtube Channel where I record screencasts of things I&rsquo;ve learned. The only thing that&rsquo;s stopping me is the not-so-quality sound recorder that comes with my laptop.</p>

<h3>Seagate Backup Plus 5TB Desktop External Hard Drive</h3>

<p><img src="/images/posts/christmas_wishlist_2014/seagate.jpg" alt="seagate external hard drive" /></p>

<p>Last thing on this list is this 5TB External Hard Drive from Seagate. I download a lot of stuff from the internet to prepare for events where there is no internet and I have nothing to do on my computer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As developers, no matter how busy we are with our lives, its important for us to always scratch our developer itches every now and then. What I mean by itches are the things that you want to do as a developer. Be it working on a side-project that you&rsquo;ve been wanting to do for months, playing with a new technology, library or a programming language. Or reading an in-depth article about a new programming technique. Or watching a video tutorial about a framework that you&rsquo;ve been wanting to learn. Or watching recorded talks from developer conferences all over the world. Or writing an article about a cool technique you&rsquo;ve discovered recently. And other things that you always have at the back of your mind but never really got to do because of lack of time.</p>

<p>Lack of time is always the reason we give to ourselves. But time is not really the problem. We can always make time for something if we really love to do it. Yes we also have lives to live. But we also need to give priority to the things that matter to us as a developer. As a developers, we have the responsibility for continuous learning. To improve our craft for the better. And this is what it means to scratch your developer itch. If you have it, you&rsquo;ll always find time to scratch it no matter how busy you may be.</p>

<p>On the contrary, we also have lives to live. Nothing is more important than our families and our lives as actual people. So giving time to that is our priority as a human being. After all life is not all about work. Life is about living it in the best way possible. And that is through spending quality time with our loved one&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>In conclusion, its really all about balance. If you can&rsquo;t find time every weekend to scratch your own developer itch, then maybe do it once or twice a month. Maybe 4-8 hours twice a month doing a side project is a good start. You can also go to work early and read up on blogs before and after the alloted time for work. Listen to podcasts while commuting. Most podcasts provide download links to each episode which you can save into your mp3 player of smartphone. Watching a 5-minute video tutorial just before going to bed. Every bit of time counts. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how little or how much, what&rsquo;s important is to give time to scratch our developer itches whenever we can. If you do, you&rsquo;ll be a happier developer. Its like the feeling you get when you were finally able to get what you&rsquo;ve been wanting to buy for a long time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As developers we tend to not give much priority to sleep. Most of the time its due to a lot of responsibilities: work, family, and side-projects. And oftentimes we even bring in our todo list in our mind when we go to bed.
As a developer myself, I tend to get less sleep than what&rsquo;s required. Sometimes not enough to fully function and be productive during the day. In this blog post I&rsquo;m going to share some of the things I&rsquo;ve learned about sleep.</p>

<h3>Stages of Sleep</h3>

<p>There are actually stages to sleep, its not just being awake or asleep. It is important that we understand this concept because its the core of what sleep is all about.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Stage 1</strong> &ndash; also called light sleep. This is where we drift in and out of sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 2</strong> &ndash; heart rate slows down and body temperature starts decreasing in preparation for deep sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 3</strong> &ndash; breathing becomes slower, blood pressure begins to drop, muscles becomes relaxed, cell growth and restoration occurs.</li>
<li><strong>Stage 4</strong> &ndash; slow brain waves are produced.</li>
<li><strong>REM</strong> &ndash; Rapid Eye Movement sleep. This is where dreams usually occur. The body becomes immobile. Energy is provided to the brain and body.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Factors Affecting Sleep</h3>

<p>There are 5 factors which affects sleep:</p>

<ul>
<li>Light</li>
<li>Consistency</li>
<li>Activeness</li>
<li>Environment</li>
<li>Consumption</li>
</ul>


<h4>Light</h4>

<p>Light affects the production of melatonin, a sleep hormone. Ample exposure to light during the day, and minimal exposure during the night 1-2 hours before sleep is recommended. The best light source is sunlight in the morning around 6-8 AM. For rainy days you can use light boxes. The main idea is that exposure to light helps produce serotonin, a neurotransmitter which affects sleep.</p>

<p>Earlier I&rsquo;ve said that light exposure should be minimized during the night. But we haven&rsquo;t really defined what light is. Light is not just the fluorescent light, its also the light which is emmitted by electronic devices such as laptops, tablets and smartphones. And if its not already obvious, the light which comes from a television is also light. As a developer I want to maximize the amount of time I spend doing something productive. And that almost always means staring at the computer screen until I actually go to bed. This is not good for sleep as it decreases melatonin production. A good alternative is to install <a href="https://justgetflux.com/">flux</a>. What it does is adjust the color temperature to adapt to the time of the day. This effectively reduces the bluelight which is bad for sleep. If you&rsquo;re using a tablet or smartphone at night, simply look for similar apps. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.ne.hardyinfinity.bluelightfilter.free&amp;hl=en">Blue light filter</a> is a good one for android phones.</p>

<h4>Consistency</h4>

<p>Our bodies love consistency. The idea is that you should always sleep and wake at the same time. Our bodies have something like an internal clock. And if you&rsquo;re consistent with your sleep schedule, you almost always wake up or feel sleepy at the same time of the day. You wouldn&rsquo;t even need an alarm clock to wake you up if you&rsquo;re consistent.</p>

<h4>Activeness</h4>

<p>Regular exercise is important. As developers, were basically one of the people with the most sedentary job. Our brains and fingers are the only part of the body that is moving. So to get good sleep we must make it a habit to have exercise of around 20-30 minutes a day.
Quality sleep is all about temperature oscillation. The idea is that the higher the temperature our body reaches during the day, the lower it gets during the night. And the lower the temperature means more deep sleep.
Take note that exercise a few hours before sleep is bad as it makes you active. Personally I prefer exercising in the morning as it completely removes the possibility of exercising too near before bed time. And it hits 2 birds with one stone, as I also get some morning sunlight while exercising.
Jogging, cycling and running are good types of exercise.</p>

<h4>Environment</h4>

<p>The environment also affects sleep. The temperature should neither be too hot or too cold. Around 18-23 degree celsius is a good baseline. Turning on the AC is also good. It effectively lowers the room temperature and also blocks out outside noises because of its white noise. Its a no-brainer that to get quality sleep you must always sleep somewhere where you&rsquo;re comfortable.
Sleeping position affects the quality of sleep as well, the general rule is to always sleep in a position in which you are comfortable. But its always a good idea to avoid sleeping on your stomach, as it reduces the amount of oxygen that goes to your lungs.</p>

<h4>Consumption</h4>

<p>What we eat affects our sleep as well. Here are some foods which is good and bad for sleep.</p>

<h5>Foods to consume</h5>

<ul>
<li>Cherries</li>
<li>Milk</li>
<li>Jasmine Rice</li>
<li>Banana</li>
<li>Sweet Potato</li>
<li>Turkey</li>
<li>Valerian Tea</li>
<li>Walnuts</li>
<li>Almonds</li>
<li>Cheese and Crackers</li>
<li>Lettuce</li>
<li>Tuna</li>
<li>Garlic</li>
<li>Chamomile Tea</li>
<li>Honey</li>
<li>Shrimp</li>
</ul>


<p>Basically anything else which can help produce melatonin. Or foods which has sedative properties or natural muscle relaxant.</p>

<h5>Foods to avoid</h5>

<ul>
<li>Alcohol</li>
<li>Fat</li>
<li>Dark Chocolate</li>
<li>Coffee</li>
<li>Soda</li>
<li>Spices</li>
<li>Chicken</li>
<li>Celery</li>
<li>Ice Cream</li>
</ul>


<p>Avoid anything that is high on fat content or caffeine. Its best if you can avoid caffeine entirely as it stays on your body for long periods of time once consumed. Also avoid diuretics, a subtance which promotes the production of urine.</p>

<p>The general consumption rule is don&rsquo;t eat too close to bed time. Eating around 2-4 hours before sleep is a good idea. 2 hours for light meals, 4 hours for heavy meals (dinner buffet).
Another important thing is to stay hydrated, 8-10 glasses (8 ounces) of water is recommended. You can definitely consume more if you&rsquo;re an athletic type or you sweat a lot. Always remember to not drink too much near bed time to avoid waking up to go to the bathroom. As a rule, avoid drinking too much water 1-2 hours before sleep. You can consume in small amounts (half a glass) if you want.</p>

<h5>Sleep Supplements</h5>

<p>Sleep supplements helps you fall asleep easier. Here are some sleep supplements which you can try if you&rsquo;re having trouble falling asleep:</p>

<ul>
<li>Valerian</li>
<li>Melatonin</li>
<li>Magnesium</li>
<li>Theanine</li>
<li>5-HTP</li>
<li>Antihistamines</li>
<li>Anti-depressants</li>
</ul>


<p>You can look for these supplements on Amazon or Google. Just be sure to consult your doctor before taking any of these supplements. Because some might negatively affect an existing condition that you already have.</p>

<p>As a general rule, sleep supplements should be avoided and should only be taken when you really can&rsquo;t sleep. They are just short-term fix, and they can leave chemicals in your body which can take around a week to fully expel. These chemicals might make you feel sleepy during the day which is not good for productivity.</p>

<h3>Napping</h3>

<p>You can nap around 20-30 minutes to gain a boost of productivity and avoid feeling tired or sleepy during the day. The best time to nap is around 1pm after lunch.</p>

<h3>Sleep Tracking</h3>

<p>If you want to have an idea how much sleep do you get per night. You can buy a sleep tracking device. Currently there are two brands which dominates this market: Jawbone and Fitbit. Just search for those on Amazon and pick one that feels right for you.
These devices gives you a detailed look on how much sleep you get. That includes all stages of sleep that I&rsquo;ve mentioned earlier. Its basically a wearable device (wristband) which you can then connect to an app in your smartphone.</p>

<h3>Sleep Disorders</h3>

<p>There are lots of sleep disorder out there but I&rsquo;m only going to walk through these two: Insomnia and Sleep State Misperception.</p>

<h4>Insomnia</h4>

<p>Insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by difficulty or inability to fall asleep. It can be either primary or secondary insomnia.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Primary insomnia</strong> &ndash; means that your insomnia isn&rsquo;t caused by any existing medical condition.</li>
<li><strong>Secondary insomnia</strong> &ndash; means that your insomnia is a result of an existing medical condition such as asthma.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you believe you have an insomnia, its better to consult it to a doctor. A psychiatrist can help in most cases. Because oftentimes what&rsquo;s causing you to not be able to sleep is only in the mind.
If a psychiatrist cannot help you, then look for a sleep specialist.</p>

<h4>Sleep State Misperception</h4>

<p>Sleep State Misperception is the inability to perceive sleep from wakefulness. People with this condition may report having only slept for a few hours but in fact they have slept more than that.</p>

<h3>Tips and tricks on falling asleep faster</h3>

<p>Finally here are some tips and tricks on how to fall asleep faster:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exercise in morning. Brisk walking, jogging or running will do. If you have a bicycle you can also use that.</li>
<li>Take a warm bath before going to bed.</li>
<li>Read a boring book.</li>
<li>Use a todo list, don&rsquo;t try to hold things in your brain too much. As a developer, I always have things I want to do. Be it playing around a new technology, a library or a programming language. Or watching video tutorials and recorded talks from conferences all over the world. Or finally start a side-project I&rsquo;ve been wanting to do for months. Or read an article about what&rsquo;s new in the world of web development. Or write an article for my blog. The list is endless. The idea of a todo list is to put as much things outside of your brain as possible. This way you don&rsquo;t have to think about it or maintain it on your brain like a file that&rsquo;s saved in a filesystem in your computer.</li>
<li>Get into a journaling habit. A bullet list of all the things you&rsquo;ve accomplished that day will make you feel at ease and awesome about yourself.</li>
<li>Picture yourself as dead tired.</li>
<li>Relax your mind. Imagine a beautiful and relaxing scenery such as the beach or mountain top. Basically anything that you find peaceful.</li>
<li>Use air-conditioning to lower the room temperature. A cool environment will make you fall asleep faster.</li>
<li>Turn off all the lights. If you can go pitch black or near pitch black do it.</li>
<li>Hypnotize yourself. Imagine a pendulum swinging in front of your eyes back and forth.</li>
<li>Listen to relaxing music. Look for soft piano pieces by mozart and put it into your phone or mp3 player.</li>
<li>Get out of bed if you really can&rsquo;t sleep. If you still can&rsquo;t sleep 30 minutes after going to bed then its best to get out and do something that would occupy your mind. Like watching TV or reading a book. Just go back to bed once you feel sleepy again.</li>
<li>Change position. Put your pillow to where your feet is currently pointing.</li>
<li>Take some deep breaths. Inhale then count up to four then expel it around 8 counts. Then repeat again until you feel relaxed.</li>
<li>Listen to a sleep hypnosis podcast.</li>
<li>Replay all the things you did in the morning in your head.</li>
<li>Stretch like a cat, curl your toes, or rub your belly. All of this somehow triggers us to yawn, which signals our bodies that hey its now time to fall asleep.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t watch the clock when you can&rsquo;t sleep. This will only make it worse as it makes you more anxious and pressured to fall asleep faster. Forcing yourself to sleep is no good. Just remember that it will to you eventually.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Before Starting</h3>

<ul>
<li>Check the wheels if they are on good condition.</li>
<li>Make sure that both side mirrors are set.</li>
<li>Make sure that the hand brake isn&rsquo;t currently active. In most cars all you have to do is hold the brake, press the button with your thumb and then push the lever down.</li>
<li>Just before you use the ignition key to turn on the engine, fully hold down the foot brake, set the car from park (P) to drive (D), then slowly release the foot brake.</li>
<li>Always remember to start slow. Apply as little pressure to the gas pedal as possible.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Overtaking</h3>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t try to overtake if you&rsquo;re not sure if there&rsquo;s an approaching vehicle on the other lane.</li>
<li>Do not try to overtake on curves.</li>
<li>Do not try to overtake inside a town or a city.</li>
<li>Before trying to overtake a vehicle, check both side mirrors if there&rsquo;s any other vehicle also trying to overtake.</li>
<li>Use the left signal light before trying to overtake to let others know that you&rsquo;re trying to overtake. Once you&rsquo;ve succeeded, use the right signal light and then go back to your lane.</li>
<li>When another vehicle tries to overtake yours, slow down a bit.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Emergencies</h3>

<ul>
<li>When an ambulance or police car is approaching or coming from your back, keep up with your normal speed and move the car to the side of the road to let them pass.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Curves</h3>

<ul>
<li>Slow down before approaching curves to avoid possible collision.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Intersections</h3>

<ul>
<li>Always slow down before approaching intersections. Around 20-30 kph. This is to make sure you don&rsquo;t collide with other vehicles. You can never really know what approaches you in intersections so slow down.</li>
</ul>


<h3>U-turn</h3>

<ul>
<li>When going from one lane to the other make sure that u-turn is allowed.</li>
<li>If you want to give yourself more space, park your car on the side of the road first then when the road is clear, maneuver the wheel to the left. Most of the time you&rsquo;ll have to turn the wheel to the left until its limit. If it isn&rsquo;t enough, stop the car with the foot brake and then use reverse mode to move the car backwards a bit. Use the foot brake again and then turn the car to drive mode and turn the wheel to the left as much as its needed. Just before the car is completely facing in the right direction, turn the wheel to the right until its in its neutral position. Most wheels in modern cars actually go back to neutral position automatically but its safer if you don&rsquo;t rely on that. Because most of the time you&rsquo;ll want to move it to neutral position as fast as you can.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Speed</h3>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t try to go faster than what you can handle. My personal limit is 60 kph, I don&rsquo;t try to go faster than that.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Rough Road</h3>

<ul>
<li>If you actually care for your car, slow down when approaching rough roads.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Horn</h3>

<ul>
<li>Only use the horn when its absolutely necessary. Sometimes its prohibited to use it on some areas.</li>
<li>Do not use the horn to vent out your frustration. An example of this is when bicycle riders or sidewalk vendors use the road as if they were riding a car. Just give the horn a light tap, and if the bicycle rider still doesn&rsquo;t move to the side simply go pass them if the situation allows.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Stay Cool</h3>

<ul>
<li>Be sure to keep your head cool at all times. You don&rsquo;t want your driving to be affected because of your frustration.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Parking</h3>

<ul>
<li>Be sure that you are only parking your car where it is allowed.</li>
<li>Completely stop the car with the foot brake before putting the car into park mode and pulling the hand brake.</li>
<li>Be sure to leave enough space to maneuver your car later on. You don&rsquo;t want to get to close to another car to avoid scratching it.</li>
<li>If the situation allows, use reverse mode when parking your car, this means that the tail of your car goes inside and the head is outside. This makes it easier for you to go out later on.</li>
</ul>


<p>That&rsquo;s it! I&rsquo;m still a beginner at this so I&rsquo;ll be adding more things to this blog post in future as I learn more things about driving. For now I&rsquo;m going to leave you with this saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>Better late than dead.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m still on side-project frenzy. This week its the <a href="https://github.com/anchetaWern/laravel-bootstrap-starter">Laravel Bootstrap Starter</a>.
I created this project to make it easier for me to setup a Laravel project faster. I&rsquo;m using Laravel in the company that I work for and every time I start a new project I have to install it via composer, configure it so that it doesn&rsquo;t show <code>/public</code> in the URL. From there I add the default controllers, add the sign up and login code, add the functionality for updating and resetting password, install node, grunt and then bower. And then install the grunt plugins that I need for front-end performance optimization. The list goes on, and just setting up a project may take a whole day. That&rsquo;s why I decided to create this project.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>Like most of the projects that I decided to do so far. It only contains the essential features:</p>

<ul>
<li>sign up and login</li>
<li>resetting passwords</li>
<li>admin (updating account information)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Future Plans</h3>

<p>As I move along with this project I&rsquo;m gonna be adding the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>social login</strong> &ndash; google, twitter, facebook, linkedin</li>
<li><strong>database backup</strong> &ndash; every project must have an automated database backup functionality. I&rsquo;m thinking of using cron for running the backup script and then upload the backup to an Amazon s3 bucket.</li>
<li><strong>generators</strong> &ndash; there are 2 projects doing this already, one is <a href="https://github.com/JeffreyWay/Laravel-4-Generators">Jeffrey Way&rsquo;s Laravel 4 Generators</a> and the other is <a href="https://github.com/wdollar/Laravel-4-Generators-Bootstrap-3">Wes Dollar&rsquo;s forked version</a>, both looks pretty good. I think I&rsquo;ll be able to get some ideas from these projects. Basically the plan here is to be able to use the terminal for generating boilerplate code which I can then build upon.</li>
<li><strong>build tool integration</strong> &ndash; I want to be able to just hit one command and it will install and configure everything that I need to get the project started. Yeoman seems to be a very good fit for this.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve been in side-project frenzy these past few weeks. And this time I&rsquo;m writing again about another side-project that I&rsquo;ve been working on, its called <a href="https://github.com/anchetaWern/ahead">Ahead</a>. Ahead is an app that allows you to schedule posts to your facebook, twitter and linkedin accounts. Pretty much like Buffer. But Buffer has limits for free accounts, that&rsquo;s why I built this app so I can schedule posts without limits.</p>

<h3>How to Use</h3>

<p>You can use Ahead by going to its <a href="http://ec2-54-68-251-216.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/">demo website</a>. Create and account then login. Once logged in, go to the networks page and connect the accounts where you want to publish by clicking on the connect button:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/intro_to_ahead/networks.png" alt="networks" /></p>

<p>Once your accounts has been connected, you can now start scheduling posts:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/intro_to_ahead/schedulenew_post.png" alt="schedule new post" /></p>

<p>You can check the time in which your post will be published from the posts page. From the published column you can also see if your post has already been published or not:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/intro_to_ahead/posts.png" alt="posts" /></p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to select the networks in which you want to publish all the time, you can visit the settings page and then select the networks which you want to select by default:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/intro_to_ahead/settings.png" alt="settings" /></p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want your posts to be published one hour after another you can also add custom schedules by visiting the schedules page:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/intro_to_ahead/schedule.png" alt="new schedule" /></p>

<p>Just select an interval that you want and it will be available as an option when you schedule a new post. Of course you can also select a default schedule from the settings page once you&rsquo;re done creating a schedule. Currently only the following intervals are supported:</p>

<ul>
<li>every 1 hour</li>
<li>every 2 hours</li>
<li>every 3 hours</li>
<li>every 4 hours</li>
<li>every 5 hours</li>
<li>random time in the next 72 hours (3 days)</li>
<li>random time in the next 168 hours (1 week)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Future Plans</h3>

<p>Ahead is still in early stages of development. Its already quite functional but I&rsquo;m planning to add the following features in the future:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Publish posts without links</strong> &ndash; currently it can only publish posts with links in it. I originally envisioned this project for my personal use only and I don&rsquo;t really schedule posts without links in it.</li>
<li><strong>Add social login</strong> &ndash; currently you can only start using the app by signing up with your email.</li>
<li><strong>Email verification</strong> &ndash; currently you can use fake emails when signing up.</li>
<li><strong>Editing and deleting posts</strong> &ndash; currently you can no longer edit posts that has already been scheduled. I&rsquo;m planning to add an edit or delete feature in order for users to be able to make changes to their scheduled posts.</li>
<li><strong>Immediate publishing</strong> &ndash; currently only scheduled posts are supported.</li>
<li><strong>Add custom intervals to schedules</strong></li>
</ul>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple of weeks ago I started building a project called <a href="https://github.com/anchetaWern/publicizr">Publicizr</a>. I created it for the sole purpose of easily publishing a link to my Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn profile whenever I publish a new post on this blog.</p>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

<p>This project depends on the following Ruby gems in order to work:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hexgnu/linkedin">linkedin</a> &ndash; used for connecting/publishing to Linkedin.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sferik/twitter">twitter</a> &ndash; used for connecting/publishing to Twitter.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/arsduo/koala">koala</a> &ndash; used for connecting/publishing to Facebook.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mperham/em-resolv-replace">em-resolv-replace</a> &ndash; used for fixing the issue with koala not being able to publish to Facebook from the localhost.</li>
</ul>


<h3>How to Install</h3>

<p>You can install Publicizr by requiring the following Ruby gems in the Gemfile used by your static blogging engine:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>gem 'linkedin', '~&gt; 1.0.0'
</span><span class='line'>gem 'twitter', '~&gt; 5.11.0'
</span><span class='line'>gem 'koala', '~&gt; 1.10.1'
</span><span class='line'>gem 'em-resolv-replace', '~&gt; 1.1.3'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once you&rsquo;ve added those, save the changes to the Gemfile then execute <code>bundle install</code> on your terminal.</p>

<p>Once everything is installed, look for the <code>Rakefile</code> used in your static blogging engine. For Octopress/Jekyll its located in its root directory. Next add the following on the <code>Rakefile</code>. If the <code>Rakefile</code> is requiring other gems, just put these below those gems. If not then put it on the first line of the <code>Rakefile</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>require "twitter"
</span><span class='line'>require "koala"
</span><span class='line'>require "linkedin"
</span><span class='line'>require "resolv-replace"</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Next, put these on the last line of the <code>Rakefile</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>task :publish, :content do |t, args|
</span><span class='line'>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  else
</span><span class='line'>    puts "Supply your post!"
</span><span class='line'>  end
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>end</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Basically what it does is declaring a rake task that will publish whatever content you pass into it. If you don&rsquo;t need to publish to all 3 (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn), feel free to comment out the lines between the lines which says &lsquo;#start post to facebook&rsquo; and &lsquo;#end post to facebook&rsquo;. Just replace &lsquo;facebook&rsquo; with your social network of choice.</p>

<p>At this point the project still requires you to create your own app on each of the social networks. You can do that by visiting the following links and then look for the page for creating a new app:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook</a></li>
<li><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/">Twitter</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Once that&rsquo;s done, you also need to create an app using your language of choice (PHP, Ruby, or Python) that will allow you to retrieve user tokens. If you&rsquo;re primarily a PHP developer you can use the following libraries to ease the work that you need to do:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client">thephpleagues/oauth2-client</a> &ndash; supports facebook and linkedin.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/themattharris/tmhOAuth">thmOAuth</a> &ndash; supports twitter.</li>
</ul>


<p>Once you&rsquo;ve acquired the applications keys and user tokens you can now replace the values which says something like <code>{twitter-app-key}</code>, <code>{twitter-app-secret}</code> on the <code>publish</code> task in your <code>Rakefile</code>. Basically anything that&rsquo;s wrapped in curly brackets, you need to replace those in order for the plugin to fully function.</p>

<h3>How to Use</h3>

<p>You can use publicizr by executing the <code>publish</code> task then supplying the content of your post as an argument:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rake publish["new blog post: newsletters I subscribe to http://wern-ancheta.com/blog/2014/09/07/newsletters-i-subscribe-to/"]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Support</h3>

<p>Any Ruby based static blogging engine is supported. You can check out this <a href="http://blog.iwantmyname.com/2014/05/the-updated-big-list-of-static-website-generators-for-your-site-blog-or-wiki.html">big list of static blogging engines</a> and look for the ones that are built using Ruby.</p>

<h3>Future Plans</h3>

<p>Publicizr is already useable but still requires a bunch of work in order to get setup and running. That&rsquo;s why I plan to add the following features in the future:</p>

<ul>
<li>automatically detect last post that was created and publish it automatically when the blog is deployed.</li>
<li>website for retrieving user access tokens which you can then paste into the rake file. This removes the need for creating your own apps and retrieving your keys from it.</li>
</ul>
