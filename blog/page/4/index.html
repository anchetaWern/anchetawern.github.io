  <div class="entry-content"><p>Organizing JavaScript code is not really that easy especially if you have to do it from scratch.
Event handlers, DOM Manipulation code, form validation code,
code for generating effects, code for submitting data or getting data from the server
can be all over the place. This is the reason why some smart people created JavaScript frameworks
like Knockout.js, Ember.js, Backbone.js, and Batman.js to make organizing JavaScript code much easier.</p>

<p>In this tutorial were going to build a very simple registration system using knockout.js.
Were going to use PHP and MySQL for the backend.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what our final output would look like:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><ol>
<li>Write Code</li>
<li>Test in the browser</li>
<li>If it works, continue writing another code. If it doesn&rsquo;t, identify what&rsquo;s wrong with the code and debug it.</li>
</ol>


<p>Does these steps look familiar to you? Usually that&rsquo;s enough for small-sized software which only takes 1-2 months to develop. But the same is not true for medium-large sized software which takes 3-12 months to develop.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve made a lot of mistakes when I developed a large size software and here are some of those:</p>

<ul>
<li>No server-side validation</li>
<li>Repeated code everywhere</li>
<li>Procedural code everywhere</li>
<li>Not using MVC</li>
<li>Non-defensive programming</li>
<li>No code written for when things doesn&rsquo;t go as expected (error handlers)</li>
<li>No code written that will handle concurrency</li>
<li>No unit testing</li>
</ul>


<p>I&rsquo;ve made a lot of mistakes that I don&rsquo;t want others to repeat again that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m writing about it.</p>

<h4>No server-side validation</h4>

<p>Don&rsquo;t write validation code for just the server side or client side alone.
There should be validations written for both the client side and the server side.
This may sound absurd but that&rsquo;s just how things should be.
We need to write client side validation code to automatically inform the user as soon as possible(onKeyUp, onBlur)
if the inputted data is invalid or incorrect.
But we also need to write server side validation to deal with malicious users who can simply disable JavaScript in their browsers to compromise the client side validation. This will also serve as a backup validation in case your client side validation fails you.</p>

<h4>Repeated code everywhere</h4>

<p>Don&rsquo;t just copy and paste code everywhere. Normally you would do this to save time but you&rsquo;re not actually saving time in the long-run. It will be a nightmare maintaining code that has the same code everywhere. This means that if there are some changes in the markup you will have to change the JavaScript code which depends on that markup.
You can say that you won&rsquo;t ever need to make changes but it will always happen. No code is ever written on stone.</p>

<h4>Procedural code everywhere</h4>

<p>You would also want to avoid writing procedural code. You will most likely have to write object oriented code for medium-large sized software to avoid code repetition.
The main idea behind object oriented programming is that you write classes which has member variables and methods that you can reuse later on.</p>

<h4>Not Using MVC</h4>

<p>MVC is basically a way to separate the business logic (computations, how you treat the data) from the presentation (things that the user sees). In other words its a way on how you organize your code so that its easier to find things later on. It usually takes longer to write code that follows the MVC pattern but the time that you will save in maintaining(understanding) code written in this pattern would be the biggest reason why you would want to use it.</p>

<h4>Non-defensive Programming</h4>

<p>You would also want to avoid the mentality that things can&rsquo;t go wrong. Because the truth is they always will(especially on production). Always be a negative thinker when programming. Think of ways in which your code can break.
Think of user inputs that can break through your validation and test them against your code. Always ask the question &ldquo;what if?&rdquo;.</p>

<ul>
<li>What if I enter an sql query that drops the whole table from the database?</li>
<li>What if the server suddenly burns and turns to ashes?</li>
<li>What if the data wasn&rsquo;t backed up and the server is strucked by lightning?</li>
<li>What if the system is used by 1 million users at the same time?</li>
</ul>


<p>Just don&rsquo;t go overboard when asking yourself these questions. Just think of what can possibly happen.</p>

<h4>No code written for when things doesn&rsquo;t go as expected (error handlers)</h4>

<p>Always write code that will handle errors no matter how smoothly you think the software will flow.
It&rsquo;s like the Plan B for when Plan A fails.</p>

<h4>No code written that will handle concurrency</h4>

<p>Always try to see to it that the code that you are writing will be able to handle concurrency.
What I mean by concurrency is that when 10 million users try to register an account on your app at once.
What will happen to the server or the database? Be sure you know how many users will most likely use the software at once then test against it.</p>

<h4>No unit testing</h4>

<p>Lastly there&rsquo;s unit testing. If you&rsquo;re not aware of TDD you should start researching and apply it on your future projects. It&rsquo;s a good way to ensure that the code is really working. You will have to write twice or thrice as much code when applying TDD but the amount of time that you can save in ensuring that a piece of code still works after some modifications and updates would be the main reason why you would want to use TDD.</p>

<p>Those are the things that I hope I knew when I created a large-sized software.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Laravel is built with useful validation rules like required, numeric, unique data from a table in a database, etc.
But there are some situations where the built-in validation rules cannot handle.
That&rsquo;s where extending Laravel&rsquo;s validation class comes in handy.
In this post I&rsquo;ll be showing you how to extend Laravel&rsquo;s validation class.
This will enable you to use custom validation rules specifically created for your needs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m a terrible programmer.</p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;m terrible at naming things</strong>. Sometimes I end up with a very long method name like <code>getAllAwesomePeopleInTheTwitterVerse()</code>.
Or a very short variable like <code>$i</code>.</p>

<p><strong>I don&rsquo;t always follow best practices</strong>.
Yes I know a lot of best practices but I only implement a few of them.
Either because of lack of time to see for myself if its indeed a good practice or just plain laziness.</p>

<p><strong>I do not optimize my code</strong>.
And what I mean by this is that I haven&rsquo;t used profiling tools on my projects
to see if its actually speedy.</p>

<p><strong>I do not use caching</strong>. Queries runs all the time even if there are no changes in the database. I&rsquo;m thinking that not caching the data will not actually affect the performance if there&rsquo;s only a small group of people using the application.</p>

<p><strong>I do not refactor my code all the time</strong>.
Sometimes I end up repeating the logic a few times and then I&rsquo;ll get lazy
and not improve the code.</p>

<p><strong>I use frameworks, libraries and plugins all the time</strong>.
I haven&rsquo;t tried implementing MVC on my own. I use Frameworks like CodeIgniter, CakePHP, Zend, Yii, and Laravel to do things for me.
I use jQuery to manipulate the dom and make the elements dance, sing and fly in the air but I have difficulty implementing it using plain JavaScript.
I always search on Google for the functionality that I need because there may be already a jQuery plugin written for that. Then I&rsquo;ll just hack through the code and modify the stylesheet files if I have to customize something.</p>

<p><strong>I suck at JavaScript</strong>. Yes jQuery is JavaScript and I believe I&rsquo;m good at jQuery but it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make me a JavaScript developer.
And because of this dependence to jQuery I end up with shitty smelly code full of event delegation and variables polluting the global namespace.
Thankfully I discovered some MV* Frameworks that will hopefully help me with this
shitty client side code problem.
Writing cross-browser JavaScript code is not quite my level yet.</p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;m terrible at implementing coding standards</strong>.
Sometimes I name my variables like <code>$firstname</code>, sometimes I end up doing
<code>$last_name</code> for the others. One of these days I&rsquo;ll try to research on a tool that can implement coding standards for me. Or at least a text-editor plugin
that will shout at me if it sees anything inconsistent in my code.</p>

<p><strong>I also want to learn a lot</strong>. To the point where I don&rsquo;t know what to learn next anymore. And once I started learning something I couldn&rsquo;t really get to the deeper parts because then I will be interested in learning another thing again.</p>

<p><strong>I don&rsquo;t do Test Driven Development</strong>. Yes I&rsquo;ve wrote a <a href="http://anchetawern.github.com/blog/2012/12/17/getting-started-with-unit-testing-in-php/">tutorial about it</a> and explored some of the basics like assertions, data providers and dependencies but it stopped there. I&rsquo;ve never actually implemented TDD in a project.</p>

<p><strong>I don&rsquo;t do automated testing</strong>. Yes I&rsquo;ve heard of Selenium, Sahi and other automated testing tools but I haven&rsquo;t actually tried them.</p>

<p><strong>I do not use tools</strong> that will make my life easier. Things like yeoman, grunt and bower, IDE with all the shiny new guns and swords.</p>

<p><strong>I do not always ask others</strong> (programmers, developers, ninjas, zombies, robots) opinion on something.</p>

<p><strong>I do not constantly think of the code that I&rsquo;m writing</strong>. Sometimes I just copy and paste
thing here and there. I name variables and methods poorly. And I end up with spaghetti code.</p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;m having difficulty planning how should I code things</strong>. Something like having a clear picture on how to go about things. Yes I use mockup builders and I write things (system flow, psuedo code) down on paper but I cannot seem to have a clear picture of how to organize my code so that I will need lesser refactoring later on.</p>

<p>Those are the things that makes me believe that I&rsquo;m a terrible programmer.
But I&rsquo;m working on it each day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally got the time to play around with unit testing in PHP.
I&rsquo;ve heard about the term months ago but I really never had the time to
play around with it because I considered it as not absolutely necessary
for my development workflow. I mean I can still produce useable programs without
writing a test for it right?</p>

<p>But admit it, testing the program that you have written is not really that exciting
as writing the program itself. Sometimes we even get lazy and not test the program at
all only to find things breaking on production. (Note: I&rsquo;m referring to in-browser testing here)</p>

<p>Ok so maybe I haven&rsquo;t convinced you to do unit testing but I&rsquo;m just here to share my first experience
of doing unit testing in PHP so I think its fine.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get straight to the point and end this boring introduction.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&rsquo;s no shortage of good resources for learning laravel.
So instead of the usual introductory tutorial were just gonna learn Laravel by building
a project from scratch and that&rsquo;s gonna be a User Management System.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if my definition of a User Management System is correct
but here&rsquo;s my idea of what&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s capable of doing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Register Roles</li>
<li>Register Users</li>
<li>Update Users</li>
<li>Disable Users</li>
<li>Update Transactions which can be performed by each role</li>
<li>Login Users</li>
<li>Limit Transactions that can be performed by each role</li>
</ul>


<p>Yup! that&rsquo;s a lot so you might want to go ahead and grab some coffee and some snacks

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><h4>On Formal Education</h4>

<p>Do you think its important to have a formal education when it comes to IT?
For me its a yes and no.</p>

<p>Yes its important because formal education gives you the foundation, the basic
things that you need to know about IT. Things like computer hardware and software,
internet, algorithms, flowcharts, data structures, conditional statements,
loops, databases, normalization.
These things are all thought in school and once you graduate you will most likely
have all the requirements to get an entry-level job at an IT company.</p>

<p>But I would also say no because there are some successful people in IT(mostly programmers and designers) who didn&rsquo;t
took up Computer Science, Information Technology, Computer Engineering, or any computer related
course but are working at some of the biggest companies like Google, Yahoo, Twitter and Amazon.
Most of the <a href="https://twitter.com/wern_ancheta/following">developers that I know</a> are self-taught.
Which means that they have no background in IT and Programming before they decided to become developers.
Most of the things that they know are things that they have thought themselves how to do (self-study).
Using learning resources like Google, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a>, <a href="http://php.net/">PHP.Net</a>
and some of the books in Amazon.</p>

<h4>On Certifications</h4>

<p>There&rsquo;s also certifications like Microsoft, Java and almost any programming language
that you can think of. I believe that certifications doesn&rsquo;t really reflect whether a
candidate can professionally do the job. Certifications are just a one time thing. I haven&rsquo;t really
tried to take a test to get certified on being competent on a particular programming language
but the process always goes something like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Review for the test, learn as much as you can on that particular language</li>
<li>Take the test</li>
</ol>


<p>You cannot really emulate what can be learned from real world experience based on a test alone.
Certifications are merely things that makes your resume look pretty but they don&rsquo;t really mean anything
at all.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on this? Do you think formal education and certifications are important when it comes to Computer Science?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>On Googling</h3>

<p>There are times when were too lazy to think of the problem and come up with a solution.
And we jump straight to Google to ask for help:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/dont_copy_paste/howtophp.jpg" alt="how to php" /></p>

<p>If you find yourself doing this before you even try to implement your own solution then stop.
You&rsquo;ll never learn by doing this. Do this only if you&rsquo;re an absolute beginner and do not know the
syntax or parameters used by the function that you want to use.
Do this only when you need a reference if you forgot something.
We really depend too much on Google that we don&rsquo;t really care anymore about remembering
stuff like parameters needed by the <code>explode</code> function in php. Or what values are returned
when using <code>array_merge</code> or <code>array_sort</code>. I wouldn&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;m not guilty because I also do that when
I have to meet a deadline.
That&rsquo;s also one of the reasons why I have a blog. So that I can just Google things later on in case I forget what I have learned.</p>

<h3>On Copy Pasting</h3>

<p>Yes you can build a software by merely copying and pasting things here and there.
Yes you can make the software work, but you can&rsquo;t really say that you&rsquo;ve learned anything
from the experience as you have merely lumped together pieces of working code from sites
like Stackoverflow or Daniweb.
Yes you can hack and edit the code to make it work for you but have you really learned anything?
After 2 days or 1 week could you still remember how you made it work?
Or are you just going to Google it again and find the same code then copy it again?</p>

<p>This is what usually happens if we programmers needs to produce an output before the deadline.
Or were just too lazy to figure out how things really work. Or maybe the code is way too advanced
to understand that you gave up figuring out how it works before you even tried.</p>

<h3>Some Tips for Learning How a Code Works</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m not really one to talk because I also get lazy at times and stop before I even try.
But here are some tips that might help you figure out how a code really works:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Break down the code</strong> &ndash; start with the bare minimum code that you can understand and incrementally build it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Replicate</strong> &ndash; try to understand what the code does and replicate the code without looking at the original code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Start with a blank slate</strong> &ndash; sometimes other codes that are already in the file that you&rsquo;re working on can pollute your mind.
Start with a blank file if you feel like you can&rsquo;t concentrate at the problem on hand because of other codes that are on the file.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Comment</strong> &ndash; try to put some comments on each line that you understand even if its already obvious what it does.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Type it Out</strong> &ndash; type it out as many times as you need. Typing the code out will often lead to better understanding how
the code really works.</p></li>

<p>Try not to be lazy by just merely copy and pasting code. Try to understand the code.
Don&rsquo;t just stop once you made a program to work. That is if you want to become a better programmer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What technology have you played around lately? What did you think of it?
Is it nice? Is it easy to learn? Does it have a good documentation? Does it feel right for you?</p>

<p>Which server-side language do you prefer? Is it PHP, Ruby or Python? Or Maybe VB.net or C#.
Which PHP framework do you use? Laravel, CodeIgniter, CakePHP, Symfony, Zend or maybe Yii?</p>

<p>Which JavaScript library do you use? jQuery, Mootools, or maybe Dojo?
Or maybe you prefer language that compiles to JavaScript like TypeScript and CofeeScript.</p>

<p>Which css framework do you use on your projects? HTML Kickstart? Twitter Bootstrap? Zurb&rsquo;s Foundation? Skeleton?</p>

<p>Do you still use plain css or do you use Less or Sass?</p>

<p>Which client-side templating library do you use? Handlebars? Mustache?</p>

<p>Do you validate your HTML or CSS code? Why? Why not?</p>

<p>Do you use code quality tools like <a href="http://csslint.net/">CSSlint</a>, <a href="http://www.jshint.com/">jsHint</a>, or <a href="http://www.jslint.com/">jsLint</a>, or <a href="http://phphint.org/">phpHint</a>?
Or maybe <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/coding-standard.coding-style.html">Zend&rsquo;s coding standards</a> for writing PHP code.</p>

<p>Do you prefer to use <a href="https://code.google.com/p/google-styleguide/">Google&rsquo;s styleguide</a> for writing html, css, or JavaScript. Or do you use <a href="https://github.com/styleguide/">Githubs</a>.
Or maybe you&rsquo;re using a combination of style guides from different resources and calling it as your own.</p>

<p>Do you prefer <a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/doctype.html">any of these doctypes</a> or do you use the shorter html5 doctype:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Do you prefer video tutorials over written blog posts when learning a new technology? Or you just play around with it and use the documentation when you get stucked?</p>

<p>Do you always use <code>===</code> when comparing values.</p>

<p>Do you still use global variables?</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>var im_global = true;
</span><span class='line'>var person = true;
</span><span class='line'>var firstname = 'Lisa';
</span><span class='line'>var lastname = 'Dragontooth';
</span><span class='line'>var age = 20;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Or do you use namespacing?</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>var person = {
</span><span class='line'>  firstname : 'Lisa',
</span><span class='line'>  lastname : 'Dragontooth',
</span><span class='line'>  age : 20
</span><span class='line'>};</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Do you prefer to use helper libraries like <a href="http://sugarjs.com/">Sugar.js</a> or <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore.js</a> for using functions
that aren&rsquo;t directly available in JavaScript, or do you write your own library to do stuff that you commonly do on your projects?</p>

<p>Why do you think PHP sucks and Ruby rocks? Why do you think javascript is the future?</p>

<p>Which version control system do you use? Is it the oldie SVN, or Git or Mercurial.</p>

<p>Are you a solid Relational database fan or are you a NO SQL fanboy?</p>

<p>Do you still write your programs without writing test code? Do you prefer to write the program first before trying to write the test code?
Do you use automated testing tools like Selenium?</p>

<p>What do you think about testing all the new stuff? Do you test the new stuff immediately and decide if its worth integrating into your
repository of tools to be used on future projects? Or do you wait for a couple of months until you&rsquo;ve proven that a technology is worth giving a shot?</p>

<p>Wew that&rsquo;s a lot of question, I really hope that someone is still reading. Anyway if you&rsquo;re still there here&rsquo;s the point in
asking all of those questions: every developer should have their own opinion on which technologies they prefer, which style guide works
best, which version control system to use, which css framework has more flexibility, which tools to use for the job.</p>

<p>Having your own opinion means that its not being influenced by what your mentors or teachers or seniors told you.
It&rsquo;s just what you think is right for the job and what feels right for you.
If moving the opening curly brace of a control structure to a new line feels right
for you then go for it not because your mentor told you so but because it feels right for you and you think its more readable that way.</p>

<p>If you think Twitter bootstrap sucks and Foundation rocks then use Foundation for your projects.</p>

<p>For every technology there&rsquo;s always one or two things that we prefer to use.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s important about having your own opinion is that you don&rsquo;t just accept what your mentors told you or someone in the internet told you or maybe what you&rsquo;ve read in an article.
Try to investigate, try to read what other people are saying about a certain method or technology.
Don&rsquo;t just blindly accept what&rsquo;s being thrown at you. At the end of the day all you have to do is to choose what feels right for you, just follow your heart.</p>
