  <div class="entry-content"><p>These past few days I was only focusing on updating my personal projects.
Personal projects are never really done until you&rsquo;re satisfied with the quality of code
and there are no longer features that you can think of.</p>

<p>And now I&rsquo;m writing yet another blog post introducing yet another personal project which I call YellowPill.
There are a bunch of Github projects which were named RedPill and BluePill (both from the awesome movie The Matrix) so
I decided to name it YellowPill so its unique. I can&rsquo;t really think of a cool name that is related to the project itself
so I&rsquo;ve just stick with YellowPill.</p>

<p>YellowPill is a project that came out of a need to quickly create a database in MySql and out of the laziness to use
Google to search for existing tools that can do the job for me.</p>

<p>The project is only 3 days old, but like any other project it always starts small (probably taking 4 days to 1 week to finish)
but always becomes bigger as the idea further develops.</p>

<p>Here are the things that I currently have on my mind (which I basically snatched from the README file):</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating new database</li>
<li>Selecting database to be used</li>
<li>Improve response messages. Currently the application does not issue an error if the operation cannot be performed or something went wrong</li>
<li>Ordering of fields</li>
<li>Visualization on which tables are connected and which fields connects the tables</li>
<li>Dropping database</li>
<li>Transferring current fields from current table to another</li>
<li>Generating queries based on selected fields from different tables (I&rsquo;ve only thought of this last night while lying on my bed)</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of what I currently have.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Here&rsquo;s my current learning list:</p>

<h4>More of Object-oriented PHP and Design Patterns</h4>

<p>I know the basics of object-oriented PHP like Classes, Objects, Constructors, Magic methods, inheritance, autoloading of classes.
I&rsquo;ve also created projects implemented using OOP but I believe I need to learn more about it before I can move to things
like unit testing, and making my own PHP library. I think the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.php">PHP Documentation</a> is a pretty good place to start.
There&rsquo;s also <a href="http://www.phptherightway.com/">PHP The Right Way</a> and <a href="http://phpbestpractices.org/">PHP Best Practices</a>.
After I&rsquo;m contented with what I know about Object oriented PHP(though I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll ever get contented), I&rsquo;ll get my hands dirty on implementing design patterns on PHP.
And once I&rsquo;m done with that I&rsquo;ll probably test drive some of the PHP Frameworks like Symfony, Yii, CakePHP, and Laravel.</p>

<h4>Unit Testing and Automated Tests</h4>

<p>After I gain enough(but what is enough really?) knowledge and experience about Object-oriented PHP I plan on getting my hands
dirty on Unit Testing on PHP. And I think Nettuts has got my back on this with their <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/sessions/test-driven-php/">Test-driven PHP session</a></p>

<h4>More JavaScript</h4>

<p>There&rsquo;s been a lot of things happening with JavaScript lately. There are lots of things about it that I haven&rsquo;t fully grokked yet.
One of them is closures. I think <a href="http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/">John Resig</a> has already written about it.
I also want to learn about Unit Testing, Script Loaders, Asynchronous Module Definition, implementing design patterns on JavaScript.
And also some other JavaScript libraries like Mootools, Dojo, ExtJS, Ember, Backbone, and YUI.</p>

<h4>Tools</h4>

<p>There are lots of developer tools that I haven&rsquo;t implemented on my workflow yet. Here are some of the Frontend tools that I&rsquo;m urging to use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Yeoman</li>
<li>Compass/SASS/LESS</li>
<li>Grunt</li>
<li>Script Loaders (yepnope.js, head.js, require.js..)</li>
<li>AMD</li>
<li>Testing Libraries (Mocha, Jasmine, QUnit)</li>
<li>Automated Testing (Selenium)</li>
</ul>


<p>And some backend one&rsquo;s:</p>

<ul>
<li>PHP Unit</li>
<li>Doxygen, PHPDocumentor</li>
</ul>


<p>And version control:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mercurial</li>
</ul>


<h4>More on Web API&rsquo;s</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only touched the surfaced with Google Maps API, Facebook Graph API, Twitter API, Tumblr API, and LinkedIn API.
There&rsquo;s still a bunch of them out there that I can get my hands dirty on but I guess I&rsquo;ll just focus on learning more
about what I already know.</p>

<h4>More on the tools that I&rsquo;m currently using</h4>

<p>I only know Git and a little bit of Subversion. And I only know about the commands that I cannot live without.
Like <code>git add</code> , <code>git commit</code> , <code>git push</code> , <code>git branch</code> , <code>git checkout</code>  and <code>git pull</code>
Commands on Subversion are pretty much the same so I won&rsquo;t go ahead and enumerate them all.</p>

<h4>Moving on to other Languages</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started a course on Udacity: <a href="http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs101/CourseRev/apr2012">Introduction to Computer Science</a>.
They&rsquo;re using Python for the course. I really want to learn Python as well. Then maybe I could move on to Django which is a framework for Python.
And after that take on some ASP.Net which I learned a little bit from school but haven&rsquo;t really taken it seriously. And then some Ruby.</p>

<p>By the time I finish half of this list there&rsquo;s probably a lot more tools and new technologies that will come out so I will have to create a new learning list again.
Education is really a life long process. Sometimes you wouldn&rsquo;t even want to take a break.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I finally got the time to post something to my blog. These past 2 weeks I have been busy with my side project which I call Postr.
The main topic of this post is basically the Postr App which is now accessible at <a href="https://postr-wern.rhcloud.com/">postr-wern.rhcloud.com</a>
It may still have a few bugs but I think its already usable. Postr is an app that will allow you to simultaneously update your
status on Facebook which includes your facebook profile, groups where you are a member, and pages which you have liked. It can also post
to Twitter.</p>

<h4>Some Mistakes</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also made some mistakes while I was creating the app. Here are some of those:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First I wrote too much repeated code. It was so easy at first because I was
just copy pasting things here and there but I remembered the Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself policy for programmers so I&rsquo;ve done
some refactoring to reduce the lines of code especially on the client side. What I&rsquo;ve done is to encapsulate the logic inside a single
method and supplied different arguments to alter the results.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, I underestimated how much the codebase will grow. My plans
were pretty small at first, just simultaneously post to social networking sites. Boom! Done! That&rsquo;s what I thought. I also thought that
it will only keep me busy for a week but that was a mistake. Because of that mistake I also wrote the backend code (PHP) in procedural form.
That was really a stupid mistake and I ended up having to replace almost every procedural code that I&rsquo;ve written and converted it to OOP.</p></li>
<li><p>Third, I was too eager to finish it at the shortest time possible which was probably the root of all the problems that I encountered.
I worked on the project full time 7 days a week (or maybe not cause I also watched some anime and read some blogs for 2 or more hours).
This was probably a good thing cause I was really focused in finishing it. But it has also caused me to write some crappy code which I had
to replace later on.</p></li>
<li><p>Fourth is the lack of planning. I didn&rsquo;t even created a mockup as a basis for the app that I&rsquo;m trying to create. I didn&rsquo;t even sketched or
wrote anything on paper. I started typing codes immediately.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Problems Encountered</h4>

<p>Like any other human person I also encountered some problems.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First is the problems with inputs (arguments). I didn&rsquo;t double-checked what I was typing and that lead to output that I didn&rsquo;t expect.</p></li>
<li><p>Second is a problem regarding version control. I&rsquo;m using Git and I&rsquo;m very happy with it.
And yes I only know the commands that I use daily like <code>git add [some file]</code> , <code>git commit -m "[what did I do?]"</code>, <code>git push</code>, <code>git branch</code>, <code>git checkout</code>, <code>git rm</code>.
There are times when I just Google things up and I just mindlessly execute the first command that I see (probably from Stackoverflow).
There was a time when I suddenly execute <code>git rm *.php</code>. Guess what happened. I&rsquo;ll give you 3 seconds (though your probably already know if you&rsquo;re using Git daily).
The command deleted all the php files in my project. Thankfully I was able to commit my changes before doing that dreadful mistake.
Another Google search and I found the command <code>git reset --hard HEAD</code> which saved my life. What it does is to revert back to the previous commit.</p></li>
<li><p>Third is the problem with deployment. I&rsquo;ve deployed the Postr app to <code>Openshift</code> which is a free application platform.
I&rsquo;m on Windows so I guess its only natural that I will have problems when I push my code to a Linux Server.
The problem that I had was that its not loading the resources from a <code>CDN</code> specifically <code>JQuery UI</code> at first I thought that there
was a problem with my input but the problem was simply that the resource were not being loaded. Because of this I had to download <code>JQuery UI</code> to the app folder.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Things I learned</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>I learned about the Facebook SDK a lot. I learned about <code>fql</code> and that you could join tables using <code>fql.multiquery</code>.
I also learned that you cannot do <code>SELECT *</code> using <code>fql</code> you really have to explicitly tell facebook the fields that you need.
I also learned that client side can read the current session even if the user has logged in to Facebook using PHP. This is by setting the <code>cookie</code> property to <code>true</code>
when initializing Facebook via the <code>FB.init</code> method.</p></li>
<li><p>I also learned how to create Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google, and Tumblr apps. Basically the only thing that&rsquo;s common to them is that
they have an access token and access secret which you can then paste into the library that you are going to use to connect to the <code>API's</code> that
they provide. The libraries are mostly using <code>curl</code> to communicate with the <code>API</code> that the service provides.</p></li>
<li><p>I also learned about a super awesome PHP library called <a href="http://eden.openovate.com/">eden</a> which is used for rapid prototyping.
It has some really nice classes for connecting to Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus and other online services which you can easily use to connect to those
services easily.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Walkthrough</h4>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a little walkthrough of the app.</p>

<p>Facebook settings</p>

<p>  <img src="/images/posts/postr/fbsettings.jpg" alt="fbSettings" /></p>

<h4>Features to be Added in the Future</h4>

<p>Of course this doesn&rsquo;t end here. Here are some features that I would certainly add in the future:</p>

<ul>
<li>Posting status updates to LinkedIn, Google Plus, and Tumblr</li>
<li>Fetching old status updates from Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus and Tumblr and allow the user to post it to other social networking sites.</li>
<li>Scheduling of posts &ndash; Openshift also supports Cron Jobs but the main problem will be expiring access tokens. I love twitter cause their access tokens doesn&rsquo;t expire.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much everything I wanted to say about Postr. If anyone is interested in testing it out please go to <a href="http://postr-wern.rhcloud.com">postr-wern.rhcloud.com</a> and let me know if it breaks for you. Thanks!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of the Supernatural series so the Supernatural fans out there
might have noticed that the title of this post came from the usual
tagline on the last episode of each Supernatural season.
This post is not any different from that idea, as I will talk about some of
my adventures in Web Development from the time I&rsquo;ve taken it seriously up to this day.</p>

<p>My adventures probably started during my first year in College as I took up Information Technology.
It was around this time that I developed my interest with computers and technology.
As IT students we had classes such as Computer Fundamentals, Internet, Computer Programming,
Data Structures, Hardware and Software, Database Design, Web Development and a bunch others which isn&rsquo;t really relevant
to the path that were going to take later on.</p>

<p>During my first year in College we mostly worked with C++, HTML and a bit of CSS.
We built simple programs that emulates bank transaction, sorting, and other things which probably looked really
cool to my eyes back then.
We also built web pages using tables, Frames and probably a pinch of inline css.</p>

<p>Second year college was about VB.Net, databases, and assembly language which I really hate because of lack of resources in the internet.
But I probably didn&rsquo;t have much of a Googling super powers back then so I can&rsquo;t find the things that I wanted.
It felt awesome building applications that run on my Windows machine.
I got my hands dirty on Text Files, MS Access, MS Sql and MySQL while working with VB.Net.
I also built some sort of a super combination of VB.Net and PHP.
But it wasn&rsquo;t really a super combination since I was only rendering things on my localhost just like a browser does.
And VB.Net used the same engine that the IE installed on my computer was using(It was probably IE 6) so it kinda suck.
The story behind that is that I didn&rsquo;t know how to make a login system with PHP back then as I was only starting to get
my hands dirty on that language so I kinda used VB.Net for the login and PHP for the main system.
But it was a really fun experience I dive right into connecting PHP to MySQL without learning the basics first so it took some time before it finally clicked.</p>

<p>It was also during that time that we started writing queries and normalizing databases (1NF, 2NF, 3NF&hellip;).
We also did some assembly language on our Operating System course but it really didn&rsquo;t made much impact
since it was really boring and was only running on the command line.</p>

<p>Third year college was about Web Development and Software Engineering (things are getting a lot more fun).
I learned more about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.
It was also my first encounter with the JavaScript library called jQuery which made my life easier.
We built a Cart System on our Web Development, it really took a lot of Googling as I had no idea how to build one.
But you&rsquo;re not really doing things the right way if you&rsquo;re effortlessly doing it so I really gained some experience by building that Cart System.</p>

<p>On our Software Engineering class we built a Point of Sale System using PHP.
It had purchasing, selling, maintenance and reporting features.</p>

<p>Fourth year college was about Practicum and Capstone Project.
The project for our Practicum and Capstone was the same as it was a semi-huge system with 3 modules(Business Permits, Tax Collection, Administration).
I had 3 team mates who worked with me on the Project which was the Business Permit and Licensing System which we created for a Local Government Unit.
And I can say that it wasn&rsquo;t easy I had my head ache a dozen of times. And I had a few aha! moments as well.
I also had few times to work with it in the middle of the night just to fix a bug.
I learned more about PHP, jQuery, JavaScript, SQL and some HTML5 stuff in the process of building it.
I also learned about DomPDF, HTML2PDF, PHPMailer and other stuff which we needed to incorporate in the project.
I also dealt with some configuration issues.
This really gave me a lot of headaches as well since the application simply refused to work on a different environment.
We developed the application while using WAMPServer then used a separate installation of PHP, Mysql and Apache
on deployment. As expected there were lots of differences between development and production environment so I had to
do a bunch of Googling and eyeball search(literally using my eyeballs to scan the file) on each of the configuration files of PHP (PHP.ini), MySQL (My.ini) and Apache (httpd.conf).
I also did a bunch of testing and bug-fixing (I regret not learning about TDD before I started the project).</p>

<h3>Personal Projects</h3>

<p>Then came vacation time after the graduation. Of course lots of us graduates only thought about resting like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow.
But there were some who already started looking for a job and scouting some companies for possible employment and I wasn&rsquo;t one of those.
Instead I focused on further improving my programming and overall web development skills.</p>

<p>And so I built a few personal projects like ChatRo, Placio, and Zenoir. Here&rsquo;s a bit of an overview:</p>

<h4>ChatRo</h4>

<p>ChatRo was an application used for conducting meetings through chat (text). It also had a file-sharing feature which allows
the people in the current chat session to share some files which can immediately be downloaded by the people who are in the same session.
There was also a file viewing feature which is limited to viewing image, audio, excel, pdf, html, and video files.
That&rsquo;s probably a lot but the downside is that its not available on every existing browser.
Playing of audio and video is only for browsers which supports html5 audio and video.</p>

<h4>Zenoir</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;m a fan of the PS1 Game called Legend of Legaia and the name of this application
came from one of the monsters in the game that I really liked.
Zenoir is an online classroom that has features such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Multi-File Upload</li>
<li>Chat &ndash; implemented using node.js to make it realtime</li>
<li>Status Monitoring &ndash; posts that hasn&rsquo;t been read by the currently logged in user has a red star</li>
<li>Logging &ndash; student activities such as opening up a handout, answering assignment or joining a session can be seen by the teachers and administrators</li>
</ul>


<p>Building this application gave me a lot of experience in using the CodeIgniter framework for PHP and MVC in general.
I also gained some experience in using Node.js, Node Package Manager, Socket.io, Mysql package for Node.js, and Now.js.</p>

<h4>Placio</h4>

<p>Placio is a project I built to have an exercise on using the Google Maps API.
I first started out by using different libraries that abstracts the Google Maps API.
But it didn&rsquo;t provide with the data and power that I needed so I sort of came back to
learn the API itself. It was a bit harder to use than most of the abstractions but its
more flexible and it had almost everything I needed.
Placio is used for plotting places on the map and allows the user to save
that place on the database and then assign images to that place. Sort of like Geo-tagging.</p>

<p>I also built a few applications for my own consumption such us Fylo, Snipper, and Sniply.</p>

<h4>Fylo</h4>

<p>Fylo is a super simple application that&rsquo;s used for managing collections, in my case a DVD collection of anime series.</p>

<h4>Snipper</h4>

<p>Just like what the name suggests this application is used for storing  and managing code snippets.
Syntax highlighting is provided by Google Code Prettify.</p>

<h4>Sniply</h4>

<p>Probably the simplest application which only does one thing.
It allows the users to paste an image from the clipboard to a div, downside is that it only works on Chrome.
I envisioned it to be used for bug reporting as it also had a textarea for describing the problem that was
shown in the image and it allows the user to send it to the email that is on the config file.</p>

<h3>Back to Basics</h3>

<p>May of 2012, I discovered about this American company called Village88 that is dedicated to giving Free Education on Web Software Engineering.
So I gave it a try and their education is really something. They care a lot about code quality.
They have mentors who will check and comment on your work until it meets their standards.
They have courses on HTML and CSS, PHP and MySQL, jQuery and Ajax, Object Oriented PHP and CodeIgniter, Version Control using Git and SVN,
and Application Deployment. At the time of writing of this article they offer 5 certifications.
I only got certified in HTML and CSS. But I&rsquo;m planning to take the other courses soon.</p>

<h3>Jobs and Projects</h3>

<p>Late July of 2012 I got my first online job at RNLTEK Media where I worked with a lot of new things such as the Facebook JavaScript and PHP SDK,
Live Contacts API, Yahoo Contacts API, and some open source libraries such as OpenInviter that is used for importing contacts from different email services.
My job at RNLTEK media was part-time so I pretty much had the time to work on my personal projects and go through some free online courses
such as the JavaScript and jQuery course on appendTo, and the Computer Science course at Udacity.</p>

<p>I also got this project at a Local Government Unit so I worked on that too on my free time.</p>

<h3>Blogging</h3>

<p>While going through some of the blogs that I read daily I came accross this blogging platform called Octopress
and I got really interested since it had all this cool stuff like responsive design, nice syntax highlighting,
and its using this static site generator called Jekyll</p>

<h3>JavaScript</h3>

<p>I can say that my education didn&rsquo;t have much of a direction since I just go ahead and learn any technology that I got interested with.
But this year I&rsquo;ve mostly done JavaScript. JavaScript is pretty much in its Renaissance period, new JavaScript libraries are popping out
every second, lots of projects are built around JavaScript, and everyone is all about JavaScript and how awesome it is.
So I have pretty much gone with the flow and wanted to learn more about JavaScript.
I read books like JavaScript Enlightenment, Eloquent JavaScript, and jQuery Fundamentals which is by the way absolutely free.
I learned some of the best practices and quirks in JavaScript like not using Eval, avoiding global variables as they might
cause a conflict with some of the JavaScript libraries in the page, closures and that you can use them as some sort of database which can keep variable state,
I also learned about hoisting, and that JavaScript only have function scope.</p>

<h3>More Personal Projects</h3>

<p>I had lots of ideas on projects that I want to build one of those was fgenerate which I envisioned
to help me on generating code that I usually write like connecting to the database, html forms, and code for manipulating the database.
At the time of writing of this article I only got as far as generating html forms from the fields selected from a mysql database.
The application is probably at 10% there&rsquo;s still much code to write. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to finish it.</p>

<p>Before I even finish fgenerate I got another idea that I wanted to execute.
I called the project &ldquo;Postr&rdquo;. As I haven&rsquo;t finished working on fgenerate yet I decided to start with
something minimal. Postr is an application which might have probably been built before.
But it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to recreate the wheel sometimes especially if you can learn a thing or two by recreating the wheel.
So I don&rsquo;t really believe in the quote &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t recreate the wheel&rdquo;.
Postr allows the users to simultaneously post status updates on 4 of the major social networking sites: Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus and Linked In.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much the road so far and I&rsquo;ll keep on getting better each day by constantly practicing and keeping my knowledge current.
I&rsquo;ll probably do a post like this maybe 2 or 3 years from now to look back from where I came from and to assess where I am now.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Have you ever had the feeling of wanting to help other people especially the newbies in your field but
you have little idea about how you can go about it?
In this article we will be exploring the ways on how we can give back to the community.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an overview of what I&rsquo;ll be talking about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write an open-source book</li>
<li>Micro-Blogging</li>
<li>Podcasting</li>
<li>Screencasting</li>
<li>Join/Initiate an Open-Source Project</li>
<li>Join Developer Meetups</li>
<li>Stackoverflow</li>
<li>Join Delicious</li>
</ul>


<h4>Write an open-source book</h4>

<p>This requires more effort than simply blogging but its usally worth it.
Writing a book and making it free is the most awesome thing ever.
Here are some good places to find open-source books.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://jsbooks.revolunet.com/">JSBooks</a></li>
<li><a href="http://pythonbooks.revolunet.com/">Python Books</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.freetechbooks.com/">Free Tech Books</a></li>
</ul>


<h4>Micro-Blogging</h4>

<p>If posting long and in-depth articles is not your type then maybe short informative posts will attract you.
You may start out with <a href="twitter.com">Twitter</a>, <a href="plus.google.com">Google Plus</a>, <a href="linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://geekli.st/">GeekList</a>, and <a href="https://kippt.com">Kippt</a>.
Your posts can be in the form of useful links, productivity tips(keyboard shortcuts for text-editors),
new awesome JS library, link to a stackoverflow question that you have answered or something that you recently learned.</p>

<h4>Podcasting</h4>

<p>If you have a silver tongue and you&rsquo;d rather speak to help people out then podcasting is for you.
Here are some of the good podcast that you may want to check out to have an idea what people usually talk about in development podcasts:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/">Shoptalk Show</a></li>
<li><a href="http://javascriptshow.com/">JavaScript Show</a></li>
<li><a href="http://javascriptjabber.com/">JavaScriptJabber</a></li>
<li><a href="http://herdingcode.com/">Herding Code</a></li>
<li><a href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/">This Developer&rsquo;s life</a></li>
<li><a href="http://faceoffshow.com/">FaceOff Show</a></li>
<li><a href="http://deepfriedbytes.com/">DeepFriedBytes</a></li>
</ul>


<h4>Screencasting</h4>

<p>If you want to show how to do something then there&rsquo;s no better way than to create a screencast for it.
Some of the good screencasting platforms are youtube and vimeo since the videos that you upload are public by default.
A good youtube channel that I know is <a href="http://youtube.com/thenewboston">theNewBoston</a> they have some very good and easy to understand tutorials about programming and different kinds of software.</p>

<h4>Join/Initiate an Open-Source Project</h4>

<p>You can also join an open-source project. It may be hard to look for an open-source project to join especially for newbies.
Since you will have to read a large amount of code and understand how it does things before you can contribute to it.
But there are things that even newbies or non-developers can do like testing and filing bugs. One good project to join is the jQuery project.
One thing to remember when looking for an open-source project is to join a project which you already use in your day to day life as a developer.
If you&rsquo;re out of luck and you can&rsquo;t find a good open-source project to join then you can create your own open-source project and invite people to join.
Projects are really a good way to learn stuff that you don&rsquo;t usually learn on a day to day job since you will have
lots of time to experiment with things.</p>

<h4>Join Developer Meetups</h4>

<p>You can also join developer meetups. One good place to find and join meetups is <a href="meetup.com">meetup.com</a>.
Its really easy to find meetups wherever you are in the world.
Meetup.com will recommend meetups that are near the location that you have supplied in your information.</p>

<h4>Attend Seminars/Conferences</h4>

<p>One good way to meetup with your fellow developers is through seminars and conferences.
Conferences are a great place to learn from other developers and they might also learn something from you.
I can&rsquo;t really recommend a good developer conference since I haven&rsquo;t been into conferences(though I dream to be in one of those awesome conferences someday).</p>

<h4>Stackoverflow</h4>

<p>You can also join <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> or any <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">stackexchange</a> site and start browsing for some questions that you can answer at your current level of knowledge.
One easy way to find questions is through the tags which can be found on the right portion of the stackoverflow website.
Once you&rsquo;ve answered a fair amount of questions and contributed enough to the community then they will also invite you to Stackoverflow Careers which is a good way to find jobs.</p>

<h4>Join Delicious</h4>

<p>If you&rsquo;re out of options but you really want to help out then you can create your <a href="http://delicious.com">delicious</a> profile and start bookmarking awesome stuff.
This requires the least amount of effort because all you have to do is to click on the bookmarklet, tag your bookmark, then save it.
Then you can post it to your public twitter account so that people will find it.</p>

<h4>Closing Thoughts</h4>

<p>Everything we know we owe it to the community.
Consider doing some of the things mentioned above and give back to the community.
It doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to be able to contribute, you can contribute even if you&rsquo;re just
new to the development industry. The things mentioned above are good ways to learn while helping others.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h4>Elementary Days</h4>

<p>My first encounter with computers was when I was in Grade 1, probably around 6 or 7 years of age.
Back then the computer subject was part of the curriculum and I was probably lucky that we had a
computer subject at such a young age. And I can still vividly remember that we were running Windows 98 back then.
Back then I didn&rsquo;t have this particular spark and shine on my eyes whenever I see a computer.
I can still remember that it was hate that I feel about the subject. Because most of
my classmates had probably have their own computers at home and they seemed like they already
know what they&rsquo;re doing. But it wasn&rsquo;t probably the case, maybe I&rsquo;ve just missed most of my classes
because I was a sickly little boy back then. You could say that the hospital was my second home.
So that might have created the illusion that I didn&rsquo;t know anything about computers because
my classmates were ahead of me since I always missed my classes.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember having developed any interest in computers when I was in Grade 1. But who the hell
does right? Most boys of that age might only be thinking of play time and not really into serious, passionate
stuff.</p>

<p>I remember having studied about bits and bytes and that they were just a bunch of 0&rsquo;s and 1&rsquo;s that
didn&rsquo;t really made sense to me back then.
There&rsquo;s also the basic of computers which I probably studied for my 6 years in elementary. Things like
software, hardware, and peopleware. And that the hardware composes of the monitor, CPU, mouse, keyboard.
My definition of a CPU back then was that its a Central Processing Unit which is probably true since its
the box where all the magic happens. Yeah I believe that the CPU was the box were all the computer parts
were connected and that its the brain of the computer. But no, I probably only realize when I was in high school
or college that the CPU is not the box. The CPU is the processor, a small square shaped object that
is latched into the motherboard. That was probably the first aha! moment that I had regarding computers.</p>

<p>It was probably around Grade 4 or 5 that I got my first computer (at last something to play with).
But yeah I was still easy going back then. I wasn&rsquo;t even aware that there&rsquo;s this whole new world
called the internet and I was pretty much just playing around with the applications that I had
on my first machine. If I remember correctly it was running Windows ME(Millenium Edition).
It had some sort of a tetris pokemon game which I played around all the time.
It also had this voice synthesizer software(I didn&rsquo;t know it was called that back then) that converts
text to speech which you can then tune who speaks(robot, guy, girl, big man, etc.).
There&rsquo;s also this encyclopedia software called Hutchinson&rsquo;s Encyclopedia which was pretty much my Google back then since
it had most of the information that I needed. And one of those was some quotes from popular people in the world.
I remember having to type every single quote on MS Word 2003 I didn&rsquo;t know that CTRL + C(copy) and CTRL + V(paste) exists.
My computer was mostly for play and those days didn&rsquo;t really last and my computer broke.</p>

<p>Then came Grade 6(or probably Grade 5) the final level of my elementary education. Where I got to experience connecting
the cables from different devices(keyboard, mouse, etc) to the back of the computer.
I also got to experience this whole new world called the internet. I&rsquo;m not really sure about the browser
but it was probably good old Internet Explorer 1. The only thing that I remember is that it had this Windows 98 Logo on the upper right side.
Here&rsquo;s a picture I got from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Internet_Explorer_1.0.png">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/computer_love_story/Internet_Explorer_1.0.jpg" alt="ie1" /></p>

<p>Google probably existed back then but I think we were using AskJeeves or Altavista (hmmm pretty good memory I got huh,)
those were the prime search engines back then.</p>

<h4>HighSchool Days</h4>

<p>Fast forward to high school we also had some sort of a computer subject(but not really). But I didn&rsquo;t
get the chance to use the computers since they&rsquo;re limited and I&rsquo;m just not interested in spreadsheet software
which is what we were using in our statistics subject since the book that we were using had a computer application part
where we got to type in a bunch of numbers and statistical symbols. But that didn&rsquo;t really make much sense to me I was as easy going as ever.</p>

<p>Then on 3rd year or maybe 4th year in high school I had my second computer(still a second hand desktop).
It was nothing special(probably less than 256Mb of RAM and a 54Gb hard drive).
It was this computer that had a great impact on me. It had started my first real computer journey where I got to experience solving problems
which most Windows computers have: Viruses, Malware, Spyware, Trojans and stuff.
I had tried installing a lot of antivirus software like AVG, Kaspersky, Norton. And antispyware applications like Super-antispyware, malwarebytes, and
many others. I performed a lot of virus scanning, updating, and using those application which made my computer more slow.
I also tried to make the computer fast by using software like Tune Up utilities, CCleaner, and Iobit advanced system care. I didn&rsquo;t realize
that most of these software were just snake oil and didn&rsquo;t really improve real world performance of computers so I kept using them.
But thanks to the illusion that they created that I was able to use my slow computer without complaining.
Most of my experience with my second computer was downloading, installing and uninstalling a bunch of software. That was pretty much the cycle
that I have gone through and I had really fun doing it but then my second computer had to say goodbye.</p>

<h4>College Days</h4>

<p>Fast forward to college I took Information Technology but it wasn&rsquo;t really planned I didn&rsquo;t really developed that much interest in computers for me
to want to take a computer course. Believe it or not my first choice back then was nursing.
First year college was pretty much my first programming experience where I got to play around c++.
We were using Borland Turbo C++ compiler and it totally rocked my world. I was amazed that you can actually tell the computer what to do.
We were just doing a bunch of <code>cout</code> , <code>cin</code> , arithmetic operations, condition statements(if, switch), bubble sorting
but it was really a fun experience. I can still remember programming on weekends. We didn&rsquo;t have internet at that time so
my learning was pretty limited to the notes that I got from my teacher.</p>

<p>First year college was also my first time to write html and css. I can still remember that we were using most of the stuff that web developers despise or
refuse to use these days: frames, bold tags, italic tags, tables for layouts.
But that pretty much started everything for me. I turned from a grey person(energy conservationist) to a passionate one.</p>

<p>Second year college I experienced writing code using the .net framework specifically VB.Net.
This was a huge leap from the console based programs on C++. The addition of a Graphical User Interface into the program had
put more spark on me and again I wrote a bunch of vb.net code(applications that reads and writes to text file, connect to access, ms sql, and mysql databases).
Second year college was also my first encounter with PHP, I was so cocky back then and didn&rsquo;t try to learn the basics first.
I tried connecting to a mysql database immediately and that took me almost weeks to finally figure out how it all works. I learned about Wampserver, SQL and more
html along the way. Most of the stuff that I learned were from <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> but now it rather not recommended by developers at <a href="http://w3fools.com/">w3fools</a>.
Since most of their tutorials aren&rsquo;t up to date and downright wrong. Well don&rsquo;t take my word for it, go ahead and read up the text at w3fools and decide for yourself
whether or not to use w3schools as a reference again.</p>

<p>Third year college was pretty much the prime time. I already realized that this is it, this is what I really want to do as my job. I&rsquo;m gonna be a web developer.
So I started reading up blogs, tutorials, and books on programming and web development. I started reading tech news(tech crunch, lifehacker, makeuseof, mashable, neowin, addictive tips, cybernet news, ghacks and many others).
Which pretty much consumed most of my time but I got pretty enlightened with what&rsquo;s happening on the world of technology and stuff that I needed to know
if I want to become a web developer.</p>

<p>Then came 4th year college which means on the job training and thesis(Capstone Project). On our on the job training we also had this project called the alternative solution
which is pretty much an application that we need to build to be utilize by the agency or company where we had our training. I learned a lot about jQuery, PHP, and overall software
engineering by building the Business Permits and Licensing which was our project. Just to give a bit of an overview our project was a business transaction software that allows
for processing business applications which includes 3 modules: Business Permits, Treasury(Collection), and System Administration.</p>

<h4>After College</h4>

<p>After college I continued learning more about programming and web development. I started subscribing to newsletters which are by the way a pretty good information aggregator
they send the news that you need directly into your email. I recently compiled <a href="http://anchetawern.github.com/blog/2012/08/16/how-to-stay-updated-as-a-developer/">some of the news sources</a>
that every developer needs to know so go ahead and check that out, you might already know some of those but that&rsquo;s a big list so its certain that you will find something new in there.</p>

<p>I also read books like <a href="http://www.javascriptenlightenment.com/">JavaScript Enlightenment</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882/">Clean Code</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597699/">Beginning Database Design</a>, <a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/">Dive into HTML5</a>, and <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer">Pragmatic Programmer</a>.
JavaScript is pretty much in its Renaissance period so I felt the need to learn more about JavaScript. I learned that there&rsquo;s only one scope in JavaScript and its the function scope,
I learned about <a href="http://wernancheta.wordpress.com/2012/08/03/performing-ajax-calls-on-jquery-dojo-and-mootools/">doing ajax calls in Dojo and Mootools</a>,
I learned about closures and how you can use them to store variable state. I learned about hoisting and that if you don&rsquo;t use <code>var</code> when declaring your variables it goes into the global scope which is pretty much evil,
<a href="http://wernancheta.wordpress.com/2012/08/03/performing-ajax-calls-on-jquery-dojo-and-mootools/">automatic semi-colon insertion</a> ,this is the reason why our JavaScript code doesn&rsquo;t break our page when we forgot to place a semi-colon.
The only advice that I can give you if you want to learn JavaScript is that don&rsquo;t use libraries like jQuery and Dojo, they make JavaScript easy but its important that you
should learn plain JavaScript first before learning the abstractions. This is for you to understand the concepts behind the language.
The chrome console is a good starting place since you will immediately see the output of the code that you have written(just press shift + enter if you have to write 2 or more lines of code).</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s my love story with computers so far. I know I have lots more to learn before I can truly call myself a full-fledged web developer who truly knows his craft.
But there&rsquo;s no hurry, what&rsquo;s important is that you learn new stuff each day.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whether you are a student looking for some career in web development or a developer
who have just started freelancing you should start a side project whether you
think you have the time or not. What&rsquo;s important is that you start. It doesn&rsquo;t matter
if you can&rsquo;t make the time to commit to it every day or every week. Or maybe you have
the time to commit to it everyday but can only produce few lines of code.
All of these doesn&rsquo;t matter, what&rsquo;s important is that you start doing a side project.</p>

<p>Easier said than done right? Maybe you&rsquo;re thinking what sort of project should I make?
Well my answer for that is that do you have any technology that you wish to learn but couldn&rsquo;t
make time to learn it? That&rsquo;s where your project is going to start. Maybe you&rsquo;re a newbie
to JavaScript and you want to learn about it. It&rsquo;s easy to grab a book and follow through it
but wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if you hit two birds with one stone? Building something while learning
the technology that you&rsquo;re using to build that project.</p>

<p>Side projects are nice because they allow you to experiment all you want with the technologies
that you want to use on your project. There are no restrictions on what to use, the toolset choice is yours to make.
You can go crazy and use a combination of scripting languages together like Node.js and PHP.</p>

<p>You have all the time to make revisions to it if you think your code is sucky. There are no
deadlines. But of course it couldn&rsquo;t go on forever. You must show it to the world at some point
and get some developers to look at your project. One good place to push your code is <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>
but there are many others like <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">bitbucket</a> and <a href="http://gitorious.org/">gitorious</a>
But bitbucket might be a better choice if you only want to show your project to selected people.
At the time of writing of this article, only public repos are free on Github, if you want to make it private
there&rsquo;s a price that you have to pay while bitbucket allows private repos for the price of free.</p>

<p>So yeah I hope I&rsquo;ve encourage at least a single soul out there to go ahead and start a side project.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>In this article were going to build a simple application that allows users to plot a specific place in Google Maps and save the coordinates in a database. The application will also have a search feature that allows users to search the places that they have saved in the database. Once a place has been selected it will be plotted back into the map. This article won&rsquo;t serve as an introduction to using Google Maps so its required that you first go ahead and read up the Google Maps v3 API Documentation if its your first time using Google Maps API. But if you want a quick and dirty solution without understanding anything then feel free to go ahead and copy-paste all the things.
Here&rsquo;s what the output would look like:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Blogging is a form of marketing yourself. Blogging is a way of backing up the things
that you&rsquo;ve learned. Newbie developers could use it later on as a reference when they
encounter the same problem that you had when you were still climbing up the stairs(were always climbing up the stairs).</p>

<p>Your blog is a testament that you love your craft. You don&rsquo;t make money when you write an article
on your personal blog. It&rsquo;s a means of showing that you&rsquo;re not working hard just for money alone.
It&rsquo;s a means of showing that you genuinely love your craft.</p>

<p>Writing about something helps you understand the topic at a level greater than what you had when
you were just learning about it. This is very true as you have to research more if you really want to
write a quality content that others can use later on.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m well aware that there&rsquo;s already an overflowing amount of not so good content out there.
But don&rsquo;t let that stop you from writing. If you really have pride in your work you won&rsquo;t go ahead
and publish a half-assed article on your blog.</p>

<p>But again there&rsquo;s this mentality that no one will ever read what you have written except you or your own mother.
This is actually very true. No one will ever found what you have written if you don&rsquo;t share it somewhere public like
Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus or if you&rsquo;re feeling lucky Hacker News. Or if you don&rsquo;t have real life friends which
you can effortlessly ask to read your blog.
The fact that no one would read your blog if you&rsquo;re just starting out since there&rsquo;s not much content after all. But
as you continue to publish articles with quality content each day or each week people will eventually reach your blog.
And eventually you will receive a bunch of good and bad comments. You will have to respond to a comment even if its not
a question. A simple thanks will do if the commenter is praising your work.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not really good at convincing people so if I hadn&rsquo;t convince you to write a blog, I totally understand.</p>
