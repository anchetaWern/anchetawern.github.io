    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Its been 3 months since I joined <a href="http://islickmedia.com/">Islick Media</a>, a Web Development shop based in Palm Desert, Los Angeles, California. Just like with my previous jobs I work for them as a remote worker. In this blog post I&rsquo;ll be sharing some of the things I&rsquo;ve learned on the job.</p>

<h3>Wordpress Theme Customization API</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve worked with the Wordpress Theme Customization API on my first project on the company. I&rsquo;ve used it to give the users of the Wordpress theme that I&rsquo;ve created a simple way of customizing the look and feel of the theme. Things like customizing the color of links, header and background images can go a long way in making your Wordpress theme easily customizable to non-programmers.</p>

<h3>Zillow</h3>

<p>Zillow is a home and real estate marketplace dedicated to helping homeowners, home buyers, sellers, renters, real estate agents, mortgage professionals, landlords and property managers find and share vital information about homes, real estate, mortgages and home improvement.
I&rsquo;ve used their API in providing zestimates (zillow estimates) for real properties.</p>

<h3>Laravel</h3>

<p>This is not the first time that I&rsquo;ve learned about Laravel. Its some sort of a reacquaintance since I first used it in the year 2012 where it was only newly released. Fast-forward to 2014 there&rsquo;s already a bunch of stuff that has changed and improved. Some of my previous knowledge were still of use but I also had to learn new stuff and new way of doing things. I&rsquo;ve learned about the IoC container, and how to make use of external classes the laravel way. I also learned about the authentication class which makes writing the login functionality for your app a breeze.</p>

<h3>Amazon EC2</h3>

<p>Short for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. Its basically a cloud computing platform. You can use it to host web applications and scaling is already taken care of. You can start with a fairly low performance and storage capacity server instance. And once you&rsquo;ve met a certain point where the current instance is no longer performing well. You can just upgrade your current instance and all your stuff would still be in there.</p>

<h3>Stripe</h3>

<p>Stripe is a company that provides a set of APIs for enabling businesses to accept and manage online payments. They have SDKs (Software Development Kit) available for different programming languages. Which is nice since no matter what programming language you&rsquo;re using to write your app you can use the SDK to easily talk with the Stripe API. Stripe uses credit card for payments. One time payment and subscription based payments are automatically handled for you.</p>

<h3>Twilio</h3>

<p>Twilio is a cloud communications company. They allow developers to provide SMS and Voice functionality to websites. I used twilio in my second project (Vmonial) with the company. Vmonial is an app that allows businesses to accept voice testimonials from their clients. I used the Twilio Voice API on the project. You can basically control the flow using XML files (TwiML) which uses tags like <code>&lt;Say&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Record&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Play&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Gather&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;Response&gt;</code>.</p>

<h3>WHM</h3>

<p>WHM is sort of the big mama of cpanel. This is where you can manage cpanel instances, users, third party extensions, and lots of other stuff for managing a server.</p>

<h3>Elastic Search</h3>

<p>Elastic search is an open source, distributed and RESTful search engine. Its like Apache Solr which I&rsquo;ve written about a few times in this blog. Lots of people says really good things about Elastic Search that&rsquo;s why I gave it a try on my third project (Roof99) to handle the search. MySQL was not a choice since its a database and it would be terribly slow for searching. Elastic search on the other hand is a search index. Documents are stored in JSON format and querying can be done by using REST (Representational state transfer) calls.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it! for now. In the coming months I&rsquo;ll be updating this post and share some more of the things I&rsquo;ve learned on my current job.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h4>Non-technical</h4>

<ul>
<li>Nothing is ever written on stone, the clients mind changes all the time. It&rsquo;s always wise to prepare for
changes that the client might want to push to the live website.</li>
<li>As developers we should always keep ourselves updated of the latest technology, software development methodology, or just
things that happens in our industry. I&rsquo;ve written a post about <a href="http://anchetawern.github.com/blog/2012/08/16/how-to-stay-updated-as-a-developer/">how we can stay updated as developers</a>.</li>
<li>Not everything that the client wants is possible(or possible to accomplish in a short period of time) sometimes
you just have to admit that you can&rsquo;t do something rather than saying that you can do it and then the deadline
comes and you really have nothing to show.</li>
<li>Be honest to yourself. If you can&rsquo;t do it, you can&rsquo;t do it(but you probably can given enough time).</li>
<li>Sometimes you just have to do things outside of the ticking clock. What I mean by this is that even
if you&rsquo;re being paid for a job at an hourly rate sometimes you just have to do things that are part of your job
even if the clock is not ticking since its part of having pride in the job that you do and its a proof that you really love doing your job.
Some of the things that I do when not directly working with my project is learning the technologies that I might
probably use in the project. Just playing around with it will do. And by the time that you have to apply it to the project that you&rsquo;re
working on it will be as easy as pie.</li>
<li>Sometimes the payment gets delayed because of a bad weather or changes in the schedule of payment, or a problem in the company.
These are normal and you really have to wait. But if the delay gets longer than 1 week, then it really is a problem and you probably need
to set your own rules when it comes to delayed payments. Some people make it a point that when payment is delayed by
a specific period of time they will charge twice the amount that is supposed to be paid, if it gets delayed another day they multiply it by 2 again.
And we really can&rsquo;t blame them(especially the rockstars, superstars and ninjas) since they do their work well, they deliver(even before deadlines),
and they really take pride in the work that they do.</li>
<li>If you can&rsquo;t work on a specific day do your best to tell your boss in advanced atleast 1 day before the day that you will be out
tell your boss that you&rsquo;re gonna be out. But of course you won&rsquo;t be able to do this all the time. What if you suddenly got sick? or a
rushed family outing, or your house has been flooded. In those cases you need to have the mobile number of your boss so you can always
inform the situation even if you&rsquo;re not in front of the computer.</li>
<li>There are different ways in which companies try to track your time. Some use a time-tracking software like time doctor which also takes
screenshots of your desktop automatically. Some use a spreadsheet where you have to log what you&rsquo;ve done for that particular day</li>
</ul>


<h4>Technical</h4>

<p>There&rsquo;s actually too many to mention in detail so here&rsquo;s a few:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Openinviter</strong> &ndash; This is a PHP Class that is basically used for connecting to email service providers such as Gmail, Yahoo Mail and Hotmail</li>
<li><strong>Hotmail API</strong> &ndash; I actually gave up half the way while trying to retrieve contacts from hotmail since they&rsquo;re hashing the emails. But I might
go back to working on this once required by the client.</li>
<li><strong>Yahoo Query Language</strong> &ndash; just like SQL but you&rsquo;re just querying Yahoo&rsquo;s database. This is specifically useful for retrieving information
for your yahoo mail contacts.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook JavaScript SDK</strong> &ndash; I&rsquo;ve learned <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/permissions/">how to set permissions</a> using the scope property in which you set to a collection of strings separated by
a comma(just a comma no other characters like whitespaces). I&rsquo;ve also learned how to access basic user information and friends information.
You can also specify extended permissions on the scope which allows you to do more awesome things using the Facebook API.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook meta tags</strong> &ndash; most of the time the Facebook documentation doesn&rsquo;t make any sense that&rsquo;s why articles like that of
David Walsh on <a href="http://davidwalsh.name/facebook-meta-tags">Facebook Open Graph Meta Tags</a> is always useful.</li>
<li><strong>CPanel</strong> &ndash; I also learned how to use Cpanel specifically the parts where you create database, managing the database. I also experimented
on the ssh stuff since I want to install Git on the server but that&rsquo;s just a failed attempt coz I don&rsquo;t have admin privileges.
I haven&rsquo;t really gotten much around with it because I might break something.</li>
<li><strong>FTP</strong> &ndash; I also learned FTP specifically the Filezilla. FTP is basically a way to connect to a remote server given that you have
the correct login information. I learned how to set file and folder permissions. There are 3 permission groups namely the <code>owner</code> , <code>group</code> and <code>public</code>
and there are also specific number for file permissions <code>4</code> for read, <code>2</code> for write and <code>1</code> for execute, <code>0</code> if there&rsquo;s no
permission to do anything on that file or folder. So if you want to enable just the read and write and not execute the permission is 6(just add the numbers together)
if the user can do anything on that file then the permission is <code>7</code></li>
<li><strong>Smileys on Skype</strong> &ndash; ok this last one is probably(definitely) irrelevant but I actually learned how to use smileys/emoticons on skype. I&rsquo;ve been
using skype for almost a year and I haven&rsquo;t realized that the happy face beside the SMS checkbox is where you can select emoticons to use on the
conversation.</li>
</ul>
