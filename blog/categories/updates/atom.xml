    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A year is coming to an end again. And with lots of free time during the holidays I figured it would be nice to reflect on the previous year. So in this post I&rsquo;ll be sharing some of the things that happened in 2015.</p>

<h3>Career</h3>

<p>As you might already know I&rsquo;m a developer. So I develop websites and apps for a living. I mainly do home-based work since I graduated from college. Mainly because of its convenience and for personal reasons. You get to work from home and earn money how cool is that? But recently its no longer that fun. Payments get delayed. And projects are no longer that interesting. I basically stopped doing it around October of this year. Good thing I got hired as an author for Tutsplus' Mobile channel. And I still write for Sitepoint. So I currently write articles for those two awesome websites full-time.</p>

<p>Around July this year I got a message from my college instructor asking if I want to teach. I said yes. And so from August until December I taught at the college where I graduated from. It&rsquo;s only part-time during the afternoon so I still got to write full-time. From my 4 months of experience I can say that I really enjoyed teaching. Being able to share what you know and helping your students get better, it&rsquo;s one of the most rewarding feelings ever.</p>

<p>Since teaching in college requires someone to have a master&rsquo;s degree in their field. I had to take up Master&rsquo;s in Information Technology. Good thing the school is only walking distance from my home so it&rsquo;s very accessible. And classes are only on saturdays. So I&rsquo;m still able to do what I like doing the most: coding.</p>

<h4>Projects</h4>

<p>This career section wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without me talking about projects. If you look at my <a href="https://github.com/anchetaWern">Github profile</a> there are lots of new additions to the list of repos this year. This is mainly because I always write tutorials on making apps with different web technologies. Sitepoint and Tutsplus requires those apps to be in a Github repo. That&rsquo;s why my Github has got a bunch of those apps. Another reason for the repo population growth is free time. I already mentioned that I currently write full-time. But I don&rsquo;t necessarily have a boss. So I still got to choose whether to write for a certain day or work with another thing. Some days I choose to work on my personal projects. The common theme for my personal projects is usually to solve some problems that I&rsquo;m having. Mainly automation stuff so I don&rsquo;t have to do a lot of things manually. My part-time teaching job has particularly lots of problems that needs solving. This includes: <a href="/blog/2015/09/27/introduction-to-absentist/">attendance tracking</a>, managing of files submitted by students, <a href="/blog/2015/10/25/introduction-to-shotgun/">checking of student activities</a>, <a href="/blog/2015/11/03/introduction-to-grade-viewer/">showing grades to the students</a>.</p>

<h3>Health</h3>

<p>Developers are mainly sedentary animals. That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;s a need to make an effort to thwart the effects of sitting in front of the computer all day long. As for me what I did was to use a standing desk. And jog first thing in the morning.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You might have noticed that I no longer publish new blog posts as frequently as I have
before. That is because I&rsquo;ve been busy with other stuff lately. It all started when I joined Islick Media last March. My job at Islick Media is pretty much the same as a regular job where you work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. Nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>Then I got an unexpected project from someone who read my blog post on Amazon Product Advertising API. I was hesitant at first because I&rsquo;m already happy with my job and I am happy with my salary. After some pondering I thought that extra income would be nice so I tried to give it a shot and I emailed the person back, making it clear that I currently have a full time job and that I would only be able to do this project on my free time. The person then replied back saying that its ok. Then the rest is history. I got the project last April and until now the project is still ongoing so most of my free time goes into that.</p>

<p>Going back to the month of February I also tried emailing Sitepoint, a company dedicated to making awesome articles on web development. It was pretty much a cold email saying that I wanted to write for them. That I&rsquo;ve been writing articles about web development for a while but I&rsquo;ve only been doing it on my blog and that I wanted to try and make money doing it.
I&rsquo;ve waited but I didn&rsquo;t get a reply after a week so I thought they&rsquo;re not interested. But then after exactly a month, the managing editor of Sitepoint PHP Channel emailed me back with an apology for not getting back to me sooner. But the important part is that I got an ok. And man! that was the most awesome feeling ever! Sitepoint is one of the most popular websites which publishes resources (books, articles, courses) on web development. The fact that I get to write for them is really just awesome.</p>

<p>Lastly, I&rsquo;m also occupied with my personal project hoping that it would turn into a nice source of passive income. I can&rsquo;t tell something about the project yet but once I get it out there I&rsquo;ll be publishing a blog post about it so stay tuned for that.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s pretty much what I&rsquo;ve been up to lately. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be able to write anything lengthy on blog soon. But I&rsquo;ll try publishing some short tutorials so I still have fresh content in my blog even if I&rsquo;m busy. But basically the series on the Whirlwind tour on Web Developer Tools isn&rsquo;t going to continue soon. I&rsquo;d like to provide as much information as I could on each part of the series. But I don&rsquo;t think I have time to write lengthy posts so I&rsquo;m going to temporarily stop the series.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for this blog post. At times like this I really wish the <a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Hyperbolic_Time_Chamber">Hyperbolic Time Chamber</a> was for real so I don&rsquo;t need to prioritize things and just do everything I want to do.</p>
