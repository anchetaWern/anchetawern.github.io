    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Should everyone learn how to code? That&rsquo;s the question that&rsquo;s been
running on my mind lately. And my answer would be no.
You wouldn&rsquo;t expect your grandpa or grandma to learn how to code,
you wouldn&rsquo;t expect the community worker to learn how to code,
you wouldn&rsquo;t expect a policeman, a politician, a plumber
or a basketball player to learn how to code because it not needed in their daily jobs.</p>

<p>But how about changing the question to something like: Should every children of this generation learn how to code?</p>

<p>My answer for this would be yes, every children of this generation should learn how to code. Were in 2013 and computers are rapidly changing the world.
It&rsquo;s only natural that every children of this age should learn how to make computers do things for them. And that is through coding.
But this doesn&rsquo;t mean that every children of this age should become programmers, software engineers or web developers in the future.
Every children should learn how to code regardless of their future profession.
Because programming allows children to talk to computers and computers are the future.
It allows children to build things, it brings out the creativity in children.
Programming is a great way to improve problem solving skills.</p>

<p>I believe that every school should teach basic computing and programming to children. Its a great skill to have and there are many opportunities waiting for them when they decided to pursue a career in the field of computer science in the future.</p>

<p>And to further support this movement that every children should learn how to code. Here are some resources that would help the children or everyone who wants to learn how to code.</p>
