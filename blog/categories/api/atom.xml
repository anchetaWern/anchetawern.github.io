    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this article I&rsquo;ll be walking you through the basics of using the Twilio API in PHP. But before that, what is Twilio? Twilio is a cloud communications company. They offer APIs which developers can use to enable Text Messaging, Voice, VoIP on their apps.</p>

<p>Now that we got the introduction out of the way. Let&rsquo;s get started.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t have an account with Twilio yet now is the time to create one. You can do so from this page: <a href="https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio">Try Twilio</a>. After signing up, Twilio will need to verify you&rsquo;re a human. You can either have them call you or send you a text message containing your verification code. You&rsquo;ll just have to select which country you&rsquo;re in and then your phone number. Twilio already adds the country code as the prefix so you will only have to add your actual phone number. After you have verified your phone number, Twilio assigns you your first phone number.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/twilio/phone_number.png" alt="twilio phone number" /></p>

<p>After that, Twilio will have you take your phone number for a spin. You can either make a call, send an SMS, receive a call, or receive an SMS.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/twilio/test-drive.png" alt="twilio test drive" /></p>

<p>Go ahead and try atleast one of those options so you have an idea how it works.</p>

<h3>SMS API</h3>

<p>Twilio&rsquo;s SMS API allows you to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Send and receive SMS or MMS</strong> &ndash; when you signup with Twilio, you can purchase a phone number. You can then use this phone number to send text messages or multi-media messages to your users. At the same time, users can also send text messages to that phone number in order to interact with your application. How it works is that when a specific person sends a text message to the phone number that has been assigned to you by Twilio. Twilio makes an HTTP request to the URL you assigned to that phone number. The HTTP request contains the same data that the person sent. You can then use this data to have your app do what the user requested.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Track SMS Conversations</strong> &ndash; this allows you to track conversations between two phone numbers through the use of HTTP cookies. These HTTP cookies are use to keep a state. Just like when you login to a specific website. Cookies allows you to continue accessing the admin pages as long as you have that cookie around. After being active for some time, the cookie expires automatically. The same idea is used when tracking conversations with Twilio. Each phone number is assigned a cookie, and this cookie is sent along with the text message on every HTTP request made by Twilio.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>SMS API Hello World</h4>

<p>Now were ready to write some code. First create a <code>composer.json</code> file and add the following:</p>

<p>```
{</p>

<pre><code>"require": {
    "twilio/sdk": "dev-master"
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>This tells composer to require the twilio sdk for PHP. If you don&rsquo;t know what composer is. You can check out <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">getcomposer.org</a> to get started. Once you have saved the file, execute <code>composer install</code> from your terminal to install the twilio sdk.</p>

<p>Next, create a new PHP file then add the following code:</p>

<p>```php
&lt;?php
require &lsquo;vendor/autoload.php&rsquo;; //include the twilio sdk</p>

<p>$sid = &ldquo;xxx&rdquo;; //your twilio account sid number
$token = &ldquo;yyy&rdquo;; //your twilio account token</p>

<p>$your_twilio_phonenumber = &lsquo;&rsquo;; //the friendly name of your twilio phone number
$phone_number_to_send_to = &lsquo;&rsquo;; //the phone number to send the message
$text_to_send = &lsquo;Hello world! from twilio&rsquo;;</p>

<p>$client = new Services_Twilio($sid, $token);</p>

<p>//send message
$message = $client->account->messages->sendMessage(
  $your_twilio_phonenumber,
  $phone_number_to_send_to,
  $text_to_send
);</p>

<p>echo $message->sid; //the message id
?>
```</p>

<p>From the code above, the first line includes the twilio sdk. This allows us to easily make requests to the Twilio API. Next we declare the sid and token. You can find this on your <a href="https://www.twilio.com/user/account/settings">account settings page</a> under the <strong>API Credentials</strong> section. You can either use the live or the test credentials. The only thing to note is that when using the live credentials, your account is charged by Twilio. But if your account is in trial mode, you can only use the live credentials. Twilio doesn&rsquo;t charge you when your account is in trial mode. But there are <a href="https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/twilio-basics/how-does-twilios-free-trial-work">some restrictions</a>. Going back to the code. Next we declare the twilio phone number. If you don&rsquo;t know what your twilio phone number is, visit the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming">numbers</a> page. You&rsquo;ll want to use the friendly name for your number. Next is the phone number where you want to send your message. This can be any phone number from any country supported twilio. Note that only United States and Canada are enabled by default. So you&rsquo;ll have to <a href="https://www.twilio.com/user/account/settings/international/sms">enable sending a message to your country</a> if you don&rsquo;t live in any of those places. Just add a check mark to the country you want to send the message to. Next add the text that you want to send. Then create a new instance of the <code>Services_Twilio</code> class and supply the sid and token that we declared earlier. Finally, send the message using the <code>sendMessage</code> method. This takes up 3 arguments: your twilio phone number, the phone number to send to and the message. This method returns the following data:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>sid</code> &ndash; a uniqued id assigned to the message.</li>
<li><code>date_created</code> &ndash; the date and time that the message was created.</li>
<li><code>date_updated</code> &ndash; the most recent date and time that the message was updated</li>
<li><code>date_sent</code> &ndash; normally this is empty when the request to send a message has just been made. Twilio messages doesn&rsquo;t seem to be sent immediately when the <code>sendMessage</code> method is called (it is queued). Therefore its only natural for this to be empty and only updated when the message is actually sent.</li>
<li><code>to</code> &ndash; the phone number where the message is sent.</li>
<li><code>from</code> &ndash; the twilio phone number that you used for sending the message.</li>
<li><code>body</code> &ndash; the actual text message.</li>
<li><code>status</code> &ndash; the status of the message, normally this has a value of &lsquo;queued&rsquo; right after getting the response from the <code>sendMessage</code> method. It is then updated to &lsquo;sent&rsquo; once the message is actually sent. For inbound messages, the value for this is &lsquo;received&rsquo;. If the message is currently being sent, this will have a value of &lsquo;sending&rsquo;. If the sending failed, it will have &lsquo;failed&rsquo; as the value.</li>
<li><code>num_segments</code> &ndash; the number of segments the message has. Text messages are only limited to 160 characters so your message is divided into 160-character segments. Each segment are then sent separately.</li>
<li><code>num_media</code> &ndash; the number of media items associated with your message.</li>
<li><code>direction</code> &ndash; can have a value of <code>outbound-api</code>, <code>inbound</code>, <code>outbound-call</code>, and <code>outbound-reply</code>. These are basically like the name suggests, <code>outbound-api</code> are the messages you have sent from your app. <code>inbound</code> are the ones that are sent from an actual phone number to your twilio phone number. <code>outbound-call</code> are the messages initiated during a call. And <code>outbound-reply</code> are messages initiated in response to an incoming SMS.</li>
<li><code>api_version</code> &ndash; the twilio api version used when the message was sent.</li>
<li><code>price</code> &ndash; the amount billed for the message.</li>
<li><code>price_unit</code> &ndash; the currency used for the price.</li>
<li><code>error_code</code> &ndash; the error code returned. This will only have a value if the value for <code>status</code> is failed. If you are having an error returned to you, be sure to check out the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/errors/reference">errors reference</a>.</li>
<li><code>uri</code> &ndash; the uri of the resource used for sending the message.</li>
<li><code>subresource_uris</code> &ndash; the sub-resources used in sending the message. For SMS, a possible sub-resource can be the media resource.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Dev Tools</h4>

<p>Before we move on to writing some more code. I&rsquo;d like to do a quick introduction on the dev tools offered by Twilio. Twilio&rsquo;s dev tools includes the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>App Monitor</strong> &ndash; allows you to monitor the requests being made to your app. These requests can be an outbound test/call to a specific phone number, or an inbound text/call to your twilio phone number. Basically, every interaction to your app are logged in the app monitor.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>API Explorer</strong> &ndash; allows you to make and explore API requests. This includes the parameters needed for a specific resource and the response that it returns. The good part is that it also includes code samples in different programming languages. Which you can readily copy and paste in order to test in your application. One thing to note when making requests through the API explorer is that you get charged for specific resources. An example of such resource is the resource for sending messages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Connect Apps</strong> &ndash; allows you to create a twilio app for the purpose of letting your clients connect to it. This allows you to perform specific actions on behalf of your client. If you&rsquo;ve ever used the Facebook API before, its pretty much the same idea. The only difference is that its your clients twilio account that is connected to your app. This is useful for clients who have their own clients. This allows you to send messages or make calls to the clients of your client on their behalf. This means all the charges are being made to your clients twilio account instead of yours if you choose to.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Searching and Buying Phone Numbers</h3>

<p>If your app allows your users to have their own phone numbers. You can also use the twilio API to search for available phone numbers:</p>

<p>```php
&lt;?php</p>

<p>$area_code = 201; //only for US and Canada
$search_params = array(</p>

<pre><code>'AreaCode' =&gt; $area_code
</code></pre>

<p>);</p>

<p>//make a request to search for available phone numbers on a specific area
$numbers = $client->account->available_phone_numbers->getList(&lsquo;US&rsquo;, &lsquo;Local&rsquo;, $search_params);</p>

<p>$nums = array();
foreach($numbers->available_phone_numbers as $n){</p>

<pre><code>$nums[] = json_decode(json_encode($n-&gt;phone_number), true);
</code></pre>

<p>}
?></p>

<pre>
<?php print_r($nums); ?>
</pre>


<p>```</p>

<p>You can supply the following arguments for your search:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>AreaCode</code> &ndash; any valid area code in US or Canada.</li>
<li><code>Contains</code> &ndash; a regular expression for matching the characters you want the phone numbers to have.</li>
<li><code>SmsEnabled</code> &ndash; if sms capabilities are enabled. This can either be true or false.</li>
<li><code>MmsEnabled</code> &ndash; if mms capabilities are enabled. This can either be true or false.</li>
<li><code>VoiceEnabled</code> &ndash; if making and receiving calls is enabled. This can either be true or false.</li>
<li><code>ExcludeAllAddressRequired</code> &ndash; if you want to exclude the phone numbers that require an address or not.</li>
<li><code>ExcludeLocalAddressRequired</code> &ndash; if you want to exclude the phone numbers that require a local address or not.</li>
<li><code>ExcludeForeignAddressRequired</code> &ndash; if you want to exclude the phone numbers that require a foreign address or not.</li>
</ul>


<p>Once your user has selected a number, you can then make a request to buy a phone number:</p>

<p>```php
&lt;?php
$phone_number = $_POST[&lsquo;phone_number&rsquo;];</p>

<p>$number = $client->account->incoming_phone_numbers->create(array(</p>

<pre><code>        'VoiceUrl' =&gt; 'http://yourwebsite.com/greet',
        'PhoneNumber' =&gt; $phone_number
</code></pre>

<p>));
?>
```</p>

<p>The request requires two arguments: the <code>VoiceUrl</code>, which is the URL which you want Twilio to make a request to when this specific phone number is called by someone. We&rsquo;ll talk more about this on the TwiML section, which is Twilio&rsquo;s way for interacting with users in a call through a computer voice. The second argument is the <code>PhoneNumber</code>, which is the phone number selected by the user which came from the search results earlier. Note that making a request to purchase a phone number costs money.</p>

<h3>TwiML</h3>

<p>TwiML or the Twilio Markup Language isn&rsquo;t exactly a new markup language created by Twilio. Its basically just plain old XML which you can use to do all kinds of cool stuff when a user calls your twilio phone number. Here are a few examples of awesome stuff you can do with TwiML. Note that these are all performed during a call:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Play</strong> &ndash; allows you to play an audio file.</li>
<li><strong>Say</strong> &ndash; allows you to convert text to speech.</li>
<li><strong>Dial</strong> &ndash; dials another phone number that can then be added to the current call.</li>
<li><strong>Record</strong> &ndash; record the voice of the caller.</li>
<li><strong>Sms</strong> &ndash; send a text message.</li>
<li><strong>Gather</strong> &ndash; allows you to gather the users input. Currently inputs are only limited to numbers.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now that you have an idea what you can do with TwiML, lets move on to some practical stuff. Let&rsquo;s build an app that allows the user to input a number and have a different sound played based on the number.</p>

<p>Start by creating a <code>hello.xml</code> file, then add the following:</p>

<p><code>xml
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;Response&gt;
  &lt;Say&gt;Hello! Please enter a number from 1 to 5&lt;/Say&gt;
  &lt;Gather numDigits="1" action="/choose.php" method="POST" /&gt;
&lt;/Response&gt;
</code></p>

<p>What this does is allows you to control the response that the user hears when they call your twilio phone number. The first line specifies the xml version and the encoding. The second line is the response wrapper. This allows us to specify the actual response that the user will hear. The first thing that the user will hear is the speech version of the text that we added inside the <code>Say</code> verb. In this case, were asking the user for a single digit number from 1 to 5. Next we use the <code>Gather</code> verb to gather the digit entered by the user. The <code>numDigits</code> attribute allows you to specify the number of digits. This has an added benefit of submitting the response immediately after the number of digits you specified matches the number of digits entered by the user. The digits entered by the user are submitted to the page you specify on the <code>action</code> attribute. In this case its the <code>choose.php</code> file in the same request URL you added to your twilio number. If you don&rsquo;t know how to change the request URL used by your number, then visit the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers">numbers page</a> and click the number you want to use. That will redirect you to the settings page of that number. From there look for the voice section and then change the request url then click save. This means that if your request url is &lsquo;<a href="http://mywebsite.com">http://mywebsite.com</a>&rsquo; and you specified &lsquo;/choose.php&rsquo; as the action, then you need to have the &lsquo;choose.php&rsquo; file in the root web directory of your website in order for the digits to be submitted properly.</p>

<p>Add the following code to the <code>choose.php</code> file:</p>

<p>```php
&lt;?php
header(&ldquo;content-type: text/xml&rdquo;); //specify content type to be xml</p>

<p>$digits = $_POST[&lsquo;Digits&rsquo;]; //the digit inputted by the user in his/her phone</p>

<p>//the array of sounds that we will be playing back to the user
$animals = array(</p>

<pre><code>'bassethound.wav',
'cat.wav',
'cattle.wav',
'chicken.wav',
'sheep.wav'
</code></pre>

<p>);
?>
&lt;?xml version=&ldquo;1.0&rdquo; encoding=&ldquo;UTF-8&rdquo;?>
<Response>
  <Say>Here is the sound you selected</Say>
  <Play><a href="http://mywebsite.com/sounds/">http://mywebsite.com/sounds/</a>&lt;?php echo $animals[$digits &ndash; 1]; ?></Play>
</Response>
?>
```</p>

<p>From the code above, the first line specifies the content type to be xml. The second line is where we get the digits enterred by the user. Next we declare an array containing the sounds that we want to play. I got these sounds from <a href="http://www.animal-sounds.org/animal-sounds-free-download.html">animal-sounds.org</a>. Next we just set the response starting with a speech saying &lsquo;Here is the sound you selected&rsquo;, then we just play it back using the <code>Play</code> verb.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Twilio&rsquo;s API allows you to add SMS and Voice superpowers to your apps at ease. Their documentation, quick start guides can get you up and running pretty quickly. Their code samples include some of the most popular programming languages for the web. Such as PHP, Ruby, Python, Java and .Net. If you need to add SMS and Voice capabilities to your app, there is no doubt that Twilio should be your first choice.</p>

    <updated>2014-03-20T14:01:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://anchetawern.github.io/blog/2014/03/20/getting-started-with-zillow-api</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this tutorial were going to have a quick look at the Zillow API. But before we move on with actually writing some code lets first define what Zillow is. Taken from the <a href="http://www.zillow.com/corp/About.htm">Zillow about page</a> itself:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Zillow is a home and real estate marketplace dedicated to helping homeowners, home buyers, sellers, renters, real estate agents, mortgage professionals, landlords and property managers find and share vital information about homes, real estate, mortgages and home improvement.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>To sum it up Zillow is a place where you can find useful information on real estate properties that are up for sale or rent.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h4>Getting a Zillow Web Service ID</h4>

<p>In order to start making requests to the Zillow API you must first register an account with them. Registering with zillow is free, all you have to do is visit the <a href="http://www.zillow.com/">zillow homepage</a> and click on the join link. After that just enter all the information that is being asked. Once registered go to the <a href="http://www.zillow.com/webservice/Registration.htm">API registration page</a> and enter the necessary information:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/2014-03-20-getting-started-with-zillow-api/api-signup.png" alt="zillow api registration" /></p>

<p>Just check the specific API that you will need for your project, agree to the terms of use then click on the submit button. Zillow will also ask about a sample URL where you will use the API, if you do not have a specific URL in mind you can just place <code>http://localhost</code> or some other URL which you can use for testing purposes.</p>

<p>Once that&rsquo;s done zillow will email you the API details. All you need here is the value for the Zillow Web Services Identification (ZWSID).</p>

<h4>GetSearchResults API</h4>

<p>Now that we have a zillow web service ID its time to test out some of the API methods that are available. First on the list is the <code>GetSearchResults API</code> which you can use to find real estate information for a specific address. Note that an address must be posted first by an owner or an agent in the <a href="http://www.zillow.com/for-sale-by-owner/">Zillow site</a> before it can be viewed.</p>

<p>The URL for requesting search results is <code>http://www.zillow.com/webservice/GetSearchResults.htm</code>.</p>

<p>It requires 3 url encoded arguments to be passed in:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>zws-id</strong> &ndash; the zillow web service id</li>
<li><strong>address</strong> &ndash; the address of the property to search (e.g. 3799 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89109, United States)</li>
<li><strong>citystatezip</strong> &ndash; the city + state combination or the zip code of the address that you specified in the <code>address</code> field.</li>
</ul>


<p>A successful request will return an XML file containing all the search results. Here&rsquo;s a JSON string representation of the XML file that will be returned:</p>

<p>```json
{</p>

<pre><code>request: {
    address: '',
    citystatezip: ''
},
message: {
    text: '',
    code: ''
},
response: {
    results: {
        result: [
            {
                zpid: '',
                link: {
                    homedetails: '',
                    graphsanddata: '',
                    comparables: ''
                },
                address: {
                    street: '',
                    zipcode: '',
                    city: '',
                    state: '',
                    latitude: '',
                    longitude: ''
                },
                zestimate: {
                    amount: '',
                    last-updated: '',
                    oneWeekChange: {
                        @attributes: {
                            deprecated: ''
                        }
                    },
                    valueChange: '',
                    valuationRange: {
                        low: '',
                        high: ''
                    },
                    percentile: ''
                },
                localRealEstate: {
                    region: {
                        @attributes: {
                            id: '',
                            type: '',
                            name: ''
                        },
                        links: {
                            overview: '',
                            forSaleByOwner: '',
                            forSale: ''
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>And no the results doesn&rsquo;t exactly return empty strings for the values of each of the properties. I just did it that way so you can focus on the actual properties that are returned.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example PHP code that makes a request to the zillow API using <code>file_get_contents</code>. You can also use <code>curl</code> to have the benefit of error handling but to keep things simple lets stick with <code>file_get_contents</code> for this tutorial:</p>

<p>```php
&lt;?php
$zillow_id = &lsquo;xxx&rsquo;; //the zillow web service ID that you got from your email</p>

<p>$search = $<em>GET[&lsquo;address&rsquo;];
$citystate = $</em>GET[&lsquo;citystate&rsquo;];
$address = urlencode($search);
$citystatezip = urlencode($citystate);</p>

<p>$url = &ldquo;<a href="http://www.zillow.com/webservice/GetSearchResults.htm?zws-id=$zillow_id&amp;address=$address&amp;citystatezip=$citystatezip">http://www.zillow.com/webservice/GetSearchResults.htm?zws-id=$zillow_id&amp;address=$address&amp;citystatezip=$citystatezip</a>&rdquo;;</p>

<p>$result = file_get_contents($url);
$data = simplexml_load_string($result);
?>
```</p>

<p>Once the request is completed you can just access individual properties using the arrow notation. In the example below were accessing the <code>zpid</code> property:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;?php
echo $data-&gt;response-&gt;results-&gt;result[0]-&gt;zpid;
?&gt;
</code></p>

<p>But what happens when we enter an address which doesn&rsquo;t exist in the zillow database? For that you can check the value for the <code>message.code</code>:</p>

<p><code>
&lt;?php
$code = $data-&gt;message-&gt;code;
?&gt;
</code></p>

<p>This contains a 1-3 digit number. <code>0</code> basically means that the request was successful and that there are results that are returned. <code>507</code> or <code>508</code> means that there&rsquo;s no exact match for the inputted address. There are a bunch of other error codes which you can use so check out the messages and codes section in the <a href="http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/GetSearchResults.htm">search results api page</a> for more information.</p>

<p>For more information regarding the search results API check out <a href="http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/GetSearchResults.htm">this page</a></p>

<h4>GetZestimate API</h4>

<p>Another API Method that we can use is the <code>GetZestimate</code>. This returns information regarding the zestimate of a specific property. A Zestimate is Zillow&rsquo;s estimated market value, computed using a proprietary formula. You can use the <code>GetZestimate</code> method by making a request to this URL: <code>http://www.zillow.com/webservice/GetZestimate.htm</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>GetZestimate</code> method only requires 2 arguments: the <code>zws-id</code> and the <code>zpid</code>. Of this 2 arguments the <code>zpid</code> is of interest since we didn&rsquo;t use it in the previous method. The <code>zpid</code> is basically a unique ID assigned by zillow to a specific property.</p>

<p>If you might have noticed earlier the <code>SearchResults</code> method already returns some zestimate data:</p>

<p>```json
zestimate: {</p>

<pre><code>amount: '',
last-updated: '',
oneWeekChange: {
    @attributes: {
        deprecated: ''
    }
},
valueChange: '',
valuationRange: {
    low: '',
    high: ''
},
percentile: ''
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>You can pretty much use this one if you don&rsquo;t need detailed information about a specific zestimate of a property. But if need more detailed information the <code>GetZestimate</code> method is the one that you need to use. Here&rsquo;s the JSON string representation of the result that it returns:</p>

<p>```
{</p>

<pre><code>request: {
    zpid: ''
},
message: {
   text: '',
   code: ''
},
response: {
    zpid: '',
    links: {
        homedetails: '',
        graphsanddata: '',
        mapthishome: '',
        comparables: ''
    },
    address: {
        street: '',
        zipcode: '',
        city: '',
        state: '',
        latitude: '',
        longitude: ''
    },
    zestimate: {
        amount: '',
        last-update: '',
        oneWeekChange: '',
        valueChange: '',
        valuationRange: {
            low: '',
            high: ''
        },
        percentile: ''
    },
    localRealEstate: {
        region: {
            links: {
                overview: '',
                forSaleByOwner: '',
                forSale
            }
        }
    },
    regions: {
        zipcode-id: '',
        city-id: '',
        county-id: '',
        state-id: ''
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The one caveat about the <code>GetZestimate</code> method is that it cannot be used without having information on the <code>zpid</code>. And you can only get the <code>zpid</code> with the <code>GetSearchResults</code> method so the <code>GetZestimate</code> method is always used in tandem with the <code>GetSearchResults</code> method unless you&rsquo;re saving <code>zpid</code>&rsquo;s in your database.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about the <code>GetZestimate</code> method check out the <a href="http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/GetZestimate.htm">documentation</a></p>

<h4>GetChart</h4>

<p>The last method that I&rsquo;m going to talk about in this tutorial is the <code>GetChart</code> method. You can use the <code>GetChart</code> method to get a URL to an image which shows the historical zestimates for a specific property. You can make a request to this method by using this URL: <code>http://www.zillow.com/webservice/GetChart.htm</code></p>

<p>The <code>GetChart</code> method requires the following argument to be passed in:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>zws-id</code></li>
<li><code>zpid</code> &ndash; the unique ID assigned by zillow to the specific property</li>
<li><code>unit-type</code> &ndash; you can either use <code>dollar</code> or <code>percent</code> as the value. This is basically use for specifying whether to display the dollar changed or the percent changed of a specific property</li>
<li><code>height</code> &ndash; the height of the image to return in pixels</li>
<li><code>width</code> &ndash; the width of the image to return in pixels</li>
</ul>


<p>You can pretty much guess the <code>unit-type</code> that was used for this image. Yep that&rsquo;s right its in dollars. So the image above is basically showing that the value for the specific property went up from 96,000 dollars to 104,000 dollars over a period of about one year. You can actually specify this value by passing in the <code>chartDuration</code> argument. Then you can have values like <code>1year</code>, <code>2years</code> or <code>10years</code>. If you don&rsquo;t specify anything it defaults to &lsquo;1year&rsquo;.</p>

<p>For more information regarding the <code>GetChart</code> method check out its <a href="http://www.zillow.com/howto/api/GetChart.htm">documentation</a>.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>That&rsquo;s it! Like with any other getting started guide we&rsquo;ve only scratched the surface with this tutorial. There&rsquo;s a lot more that you can do with Zillow API so be sure to check out the resources below to learn more.</p>

<h3>Concepts to Remember</h3>

<p>Here are some of the concepts that you have to remember when working with the Paypal API in any of your projects:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Sandbox</strong> &ndash; this is used for testing requests to the Paypal API. Sandbox Paypal accounts can be assigned with funds of up to 5000 USD and then you can use it for testing.</li>
<li><strong>Live</strong> &ndash; the live Paypal website. You can switch your API calls to use the live endpoints upon deploying your project.</li>
<li><strong>API Request</strong> &ndash; you can use either NVP (Name-Value Pair) or SOAP when making request to the API. We will use name-value pairs in this tutorial.</li>
<li><strong>API Credentials</strong> &ndash; the credentials that you will use in order to make API calls.</li>
<li><strong>API</strong> &ndash; short for Application Programming Interface. Paypal is composed of different APIs such as the adaptive accounts, adaptive payments, invoicing, merchant APIs and permissions. In this tutorial I&rsquo;m going to discuss about the merchant API.</li>
<li><strong>Service Endpoint</strong> &ndash; this simply refers to the URL of the server that will handle a specific request. Note that the endpoints used for testing (sandbox) and production (live) are different. So you have to update the endpoints after you&rsquo;re done with the testing.</li>
<li><strong>Call Payload</strong> &ndash; the minimum data required by paypal that you have to submit as part of the request to the API.</li>
<li><strong>Request and Response Formats</strong> &ndash; the format in which your API request and the response that&rsquo;s going to be returned after a successful call.</li>
<li><strong>HTTP Headers</strong> &ndash; the HTTP request header information that you have to specify in each API call.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Create a Paypal Account</h3>

<p>First you have to create either a Paypal Personal Account or a Paypal Business Account on the Paypal website.
After creating an account go to <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/">developer.paypal.com</a> and login using the account that you created.</p>

<h3>Create a Sandbox Account</h3>

<p>Once you&rsquo;re logged in to the paypal developer website, click on the applications tab then go to sandbox accounts. In this page you will see the default paypal account that you can use for testing. The default account contains information that you can use to authenticate your API calls. In most cases you would only need to take note of the username, password and the signature in order to authenticate API calls.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/getting_started_with_paypal/default-test-account.png" alt="default account" /></p>

<p>The default test account is a business account so if you need to test on a personal account you may need to create a new test account which you can do on the same page by clicking on the <code>Create Account</code> button.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/getting_started_with_paypal/paypal-create-testacc.png" alt="create test account" /></p>

<p>The default test account along with any test account that you create can be used to login in the <a href="https://www.sandbox.paypal.com">sandbox paypal website</a>. This is great as you can use this like a real paypal account to view your transactions, make payments, etc.</p>

<h3>Getting Live API Credentials</h3>

<p>Note that the API credentials that comes along with the default test account can&rsquo;t be used to make API calls with the live version of the API. For that you would need to login to <a href="http://paypal.com">paypal</a> then go to <strong>My Account</strong> &ndash;> <strong>Profile</strong> &ndash;> <strong>My Selling Tools</strong> then click on the <strong>update</strong> link beside the <strong>API Access</strong> section. After that click on the <strong>Request API Credentials</strong> link. Finally, select <strong>Request API signature</strong> and click <strong>Agree and Submit</strong>. This will generate the API Username, Password and Signature that you can use in your live API calls.</p>

<h3>Paypal Class</h3>

<p>Now were ready to build the class that we will be using later on to make requests to the Paypal API.
First create a new class and call it <code>Paypal</code>. Then declare the following class variables:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>request method</strong> &ndash; the request method to use. This can be either CURL or file_get_contents.</li>
<li><strong>errors</strong> &ndash; stores the current errors that occured while making the requests.</li>
<li><strong>credentials</strong> &ndash; stores the API credentials.</li>
<li><strong>endpoint</strong> &ndash; the URL of the service end point to use.</li>
<li><strong>version</strong> &ndash; the version of the API. Currently its 74.0</li>
</ul>


<p>```php
&lt;?php
class Paypal{</p>

<p>  public $request_method;</p>

<p>  public $_errors = array();</p>

<p>  protected $<em>credentials;
  protected $</em>endPoint = &lsquo;<a href="https://api-3t.sandbox.paypal.com/nvp">https://api-3t.sandbox.paypal.com/nvp</a>&rsquo;;
  protected $_version = &lsquo;74.0&rsquo;;</p>

<p>}
?>
```</p>

<p>Next declare the constructor. This will take 3 required arguments and two optional arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>user</strong> &ndash; the API username that you got from paypal. Note that this should correspond with the endpoint that you use. If the endpoint is a sandbox endpoint then use the sandbox credentials otherwise use the live credentials.</li>
<li><strong>pass</strong> &ndash; the API password</li>
<li><strong>signature</strong> &ndash; the API signature</li>
<li><strong>paypal server</strong> &ndash; this can either be set to sandbox or live. This is set to sandbox by default so its using the sandbox endpoint. Setting this to live will set the endpoint to the live endpoint.</li>
<li><strong>request method</strong> &ndash; the request method to use, this can be either file_get_contents or curl. Its recommended to use curl since its more secure. The file_get_contents method is only there in case the server where you are deploying has no support for CURL.</li>
</ul>


<p>What the constructor does is to initialize the values for the class variables based on the arguments supplied when an object for the class is declared.</p>

<p>```
&lt;?php
  public function __construct($user, $pass, $signature, $paypal_server = &lsquo;sandbox&rsquo;, $request_method = &lsquo;file_get_contents&rsquo;){</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;_credentials = array(
    'USER' =&gt; $user,
    'PWD' =&gt; $pass,
    'SIGNATURE' =&gt; $signature,
);

$this-&gt;request_method = $request_method;
if($paypal_server == 'live'){
  $this-&gt;_endPoint = 'https://api-3t.paypal.com/nvp';
}
</code></pre>

<p>  }
?>
```</p>

<p>Next create the request method. This will be the primary method that we will call from this class once we make the request to the API. This accepts two arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>method</strong> &ndash; the API method to use.</li>
<li><strong>params</strong> &ndash; the parameters required by the method that we specified.</li>
</ul>


<p>What this method does is to build the name-value pair that will be used for the request. It also builds the required HTTP header based on the credentials supplied through the constructor earlier. Once its done building all the information required by a specific API method it makes the request depending on the request method.</p>

<p>```
&lt;?php
  public function request($method, $params = array()){</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;_errors = array();
if(empty($method)){ 
  $this-&gt;_errors = array('There is no API Method');
  return false;
}

$requestParams = array(
   'METHOD' =&gt; $method,
   'VERSION' =&gt; $this-&gt;_version
) + $this-&gt;_credentials;


$request = http_build_query($requestParams + $params); //build a query string based on the array of request parameters

if($this-&gt;request_method == 'curl'){

    //build the HTTP header required by Paypal
    $http_header = array(
        'X-PAYPAL-SECURITY-USERID' =&gt; $this-&gt;_credentials['USER'],
        'X-PAYPAL-SECURITY-PASSWORD' =&gt; $this-&gt;_credentials['PWD'],
        'X-PAYPAL-SECURITY-SIGNATURE' =&gt; $this-&gt;_credentials['SIGNATURE'],
        'X-PAYPAL-REQUEST-DATA-FORMAT' =&gt; 'JSON',
        'X-PAYPAL-RESPONSE-DATA-FORMAT' =&gt; 'JSON'
    );

    //set options for CURL
    $curlOptions = array (
        CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER =&gt; $http_header,
        CURLOPT_URL =&gt; $this-&gt;_endPoint,
        CURLOPT_VERBOSE =&gt; 1,
        CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER =&gt; true, 
        CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST =&gt; 2,
        CURLOPT_CAINFO =&gt; dirname(__FILE__) . '/cert/cacert.pem', //CA cert file
        CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER =&gt; 1,
        CURLOPT_POST =&gt; 1,
        CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS =&gt; $request
    );

    $ch = curl_init();
    curl_setopt_array($ch, $curlOptions);

    $response = curl_exec($ch); //make the request

    if(curl_errno($ch)){
        $this-&gt;_errors = curl_error($ch);
        curl_close($ch);
        return false;
    }else{
        curl_close($ch);
        $responseArray = array();
        parse_str($response, $responseArray); //convert the response string to an array
        return $responseArray;
    }

}else if($this-&gt;request_method == 'file_get_contents'){

    //build the HTTP header required by Paypal
    $context_options = array(
        "http" =&gt; array(
          "method" =&gt; "POST",
          "header"  =&gt; "Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\r\n" .
                "X-PAYPAL-SECURITY-USERID: " . $this-&gt;_credentials['USER'] . "\r\n" .
                "X-PAYPAL-SECURITY-PASSWORD: " . $this-&gt;_credentials['PWD'] . "\r\n" .
                "X-PAYPAL-SECURITY-SIGNATURE: " . $this-&gt;_credentials['SIGNATURE'] . "\r\n" .
                "X-PAYPAL-REQUEST-DATA-FORMAT: JSON\r\n" .
                "X-PAYPAL-RESPONSE-DATA-FORMAT: JSON\r\n",
          "content" =&gt; $request
        )
    );

    $context = stream_context_create($context_options); //create context for file_get_contents
    $response = file_get_contents($this-&gt;_endPoint, false, $context); //make the request

    $responseArray = array();
    parse_str($response, $responseArray); //convert the response string to an array
    return $responseArray;

}
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
?>
```</p>

<h3>API Methods</h3>

<p>Before we dive into actually making an API request its important that we first understand the API methods that we will actually use. In this tutorial were only going to use 3 methods: SetExpressCheckout, GetExpressCheckoutDetails, and DoExpressCheckoutPayment. Were going to use these methods to create an application that accepts payments using Paypal.</p>

<h4>SetExpressCheckout</h4>

<p>The <code>SetExpressCheckout</code> method allows you to initiate an express checkout transaction. This is the easiest way to implement a payment operation in your application. What this does is to generate a unique token that can be appended into the paypal URL which is used for making payments. The URL to be used for sandbox and live are different so you have to make sure that the URL that you&rsquo;re using corresponds to the current API endpoint that you&rsquo;re using:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>sandbox</strong> &ndash; <a href="https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/webscr?cmd=_express-checkout&amp;token=UNIQUE_TOKEN">https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/webscr?cmd=_express-checkout&amp;token=UNIQUE_TOKEN</a></li>
<li><strong>live</strong> &ndash; <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webscr?cmd=_express-checkout&amp;token=UNIQUE_TOKEN">https://www.paypal.com/webscr?cmd=_express-checkout&amp;token=UNIQUE_TOKEN</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The <code>SetExpressCheckout</code> method requires the following parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>METHOD</strong> &ndash; must be set to <code>SetExpressCheckout</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>RETURNURL</strong> &ndash; this is the URL where the buyer will be redirected after a successful payment</p></li>
<li><strong>CANCELURL</strong> &ndash; this is the URL where the buyer will be redirected if he doesn&rsquo;t accept to make the payment</li>
<li><strong>NOSHIPPING</strong> &ndash; you can use this to specify if shipping information is enabled or not. If the customer is paying for a specific service that doesn&rsquo;t require shipping then you can simply set the value to <code>1</code></li>
<li><p><strong>ALLOWNOTE</strong> &ndash; you can use this to specify if notes are allowed. You can set this to <code>0</code> if you don&rsquo;t want buyers to send a note along with the payment information. Otherwise set it to <code>1</code></p></li>
<li><p><strong>PAYMENTREQUEST_0_AMT</strong> &ndash; the total cost of the product or service. If you have more than one item then the value for this parameter should be the total of those items. Note that any value that you supply for any parameter that requires an amount should be expressed in 2 decimal places. So if the item is worth 25 dollars then it should be written as <code>25.00</code>.</p></li>
<li><strong>PAYMENTREQUEST_0_SHIPPINGAMT</strong> &ndash; the shipping cost. If the <code>NOSHIPPING</code> is set to <code>1</code> then there&rsquo;s no need to supply a value for this parameter</li>
<li><p><strong>PAYMENTREQUEST_0_ITEMAMT</strong> &ndash; the cost of the product or service. Note that if you have more than one product you can simply set this to <code>PAYMENTREQUEST_1_ITEMAMT</code>, <code>PAYMENTREQUEST_2_ITEMAMT</code> and so on. Just be sure to get the total of the values that you supplied to those parameters</p></li>
<li><p><strong>PAYMENTREQUEST_0_CURRENCYCODE</strong> &ndash; the currency in which the <code>PAYMENTREQUEST_0_AMT</code> and <code>PAYMENTREQUEST_0_ITEMAMT</code> is expressed. Here&rsquo;s a <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/api/currency_codes/">list of currency codes</a> that you can use. If you don&rsquo;t specify a value for this parameter the default value of <code>USD</code> will be used.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>L_PAYMENTREQUEST_0_NAME0</strong> &ndash; the name of the product or service</p></li>
<li><strong>L_PAYMENTREQUEST_0_DESC0</strong> &ndash; the description of the product or service</li>
<li><strong>L_PAYMENTREQUEST_0_AMT0</strong> &ndash; the cost of the product or service</li>
<li><strong>L_PAYMENTREQUEST_0_QTY0</strong> &ndash; the quantity of the product or service</li>
</ul>


<p>After a successfull request it returns the following response:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>TOKEN</strong> &ndash; the token that can be appended to the URL of the paypal website where the payment can be made.</li>
</ul>


<h4>GetExpressCheckoutDetails</h4>

<p>The <code>GetExpressCheckoutDetails</code> method is used for getting additional information regarding a specific express checkout transaction. This is called after a payment has successfully been made through the paypal website. This happens when paypal successfully redirects to the <code>RETURNURL</code> that we specified in the <code>SetExpressCheckout</code> method.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>TOKEN</strong> &ndash; the token that paypal has appended to the return URL. You can get the token by using <code>$_GET['token']</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>After a successful request paypal returns a bunch of information regarding the payment. This includes information about the transaction itself and some payer information. Check out the <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/api/merchant/GetExpressCheckoutDetails_API_Operation_NVP/">official documentation</a> if you want to see a full list of the response objects returned from calling the <code>GetExpressCheckoutDetails</code> method.</p>

<h4>DoExpressCheckoutPayment</h4>

<p>The <code>DoExpressCheckoutPayment</code> method is used for completing the express checkout transaction. You might think that once the payment has been made its already completed but actually its not. The transaction isn&rsquo;t actually completed unless the payment is confirmed on both sides (paypal and your website).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>TOKEN</strong> &ndash; the token that paypal has appended to the return URL. Yes this is the same as the token that you used for the <code>GetExpressCheckoutDetails</code> method.</li>
<li><strong>PAYMENTREQUEST_n_PAYMENTACTION</strong> &ndash; specifies how you want to obtain the payment. There are 3 possible values for this: <code>Authorization</code>, <code>Order</code>, and <code>Sale</code>. In most cases the value used here is <code>Sale</code>.</li>
<li><strong>PAYERID</strong> &ndash; the unique ID of the buyer. This information is also appended in the return URL, you can get it by using <code>$_GET['PayerID']</code></li>
<li><strong>PAYMENTREQUEST_0_AMT</strong> &ndash; this should be the same as the value you supplied in the <code>PAYMENTREQUEST_0_AMT</code> parameter on the <code>SetExpressCheckout</code> method.</li>
<li><strong>PAYMENTREQUEST_0_CURRENCYCODE</strong> &ndash; this should be the same as the value you supplied in the <code>PAYMENTREQUEST_0_CURRENCYCODE</code> parameter on the <code>SetExpressCheckout</code> method.</li>
</ul>


<p>After a successful request the express checkout transaction is now completed.</p>

<h3>Making API Requests</h3>

<p>Now were ready to actually make requests to the API. First include the file where the Paypal class is located. Then create a new object for the Paypal class:</p>

<p>```
&lt;?php
require &lsquo;Paypal.php&rsquo;;</p>

<p>//get credentials from DB
$credentials = $db->get(&ldquo;tbl_credentials&rdquo;, &ldquo;paypal&rdquo;);
extract($credentials);</p>

<p>$paypal = new Paypal($user, $pass, $signature, $paypal_server);</p>

<p>if(empty($<em>GET[&lsquo;TOKEN&rsquo;]) &amp;&amp; empty($</em>GET[&lsquo;PayerID&rsquo;])){</p>

<pre><code>$request_params = array(
   'RETURNURL' =&gt; $success_url,
   'CANCELURL' =&gt; $cancel_url,
   'NOSHIPPING' =&gt; '1',
   'ALLOWNOTE' =&gt; '1'
);  

$order_params = array(
   'PAYMENTREQUEST_0_AMT' =&gt; $amount,
   'PAYMENTREQUEST_0_ITEMAMT' =&gt; $amount,
   'PAYMENTREQUEST_0_CURRENCYCODE' =&gt; $currency
);

$item = array(
   'L_PAYMENTREQUEST_0_NAME0' =&gt; 'Oldies Anime Collection',
   'L_PAYMENTREQUEST_0_DESC0' =&gt; 'old anime',
   'L_PAYMENTREQUEST_0_AMT0' =&gt; $amount,
   'L_PAYMENTREQUEST_0_QTY0' =&gt; '1'
);  

//initiate express checkout transaction
$response = $paypal-&gt;request('SetExpressCheckout', $request_params + $order_params + $item);

if(is_array($response) &amp;&amp; $response['ACK'] == 'Success'){
    $token = $response['TOKEN'];
    //redirect to paypal where the buyer will make his payment
    header('Location: https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/webscr?cmd=_express-checkout&amp;token=' . $token);
}
</code></pre>

<p>}else{</p>

<pre><code>//after a successful redirect, complete the express checkout transaction
$request_params = array(
    'TOKEN' =&gt; $_GET['token'],
    'PAYMENTACTION' =&gt; 'Sale',
    'PAYERID' =&gt; $_GET['PayerID'],
    'PAYMENTREQUEST_0_AMT' =&gt; $amount, 
    'PAYMENTREQUEST_0_CURRENCYCODE' =&gt; $currency
);

$response = $paypal-&gt;request('DoExpressCheckoutPayment', $request_params);

if(is_array($response) &amp;&amp; $response['ACK'] == 'Success'){
    //commit the transaction in your database
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
?>
```</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In this tutorial you&rsquo;ve learned the basics of making API requests to the Paypal API. We have specifically used the Merchant API. But there are other Paypal APIs which we can use for different use cases.</p>

    <id>http://anchetawern.github.io/blog/2013/12/01/getting-started-with-bitpay-api</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin is really trending these days with its value now over <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/171762-bitcoin-hits-1000-but-how-far-can-it-go">$1000 per coin</a>. I think its timely to explore some of the services which uses Bitcoin as a form of payment. Last time I also showed you how to <a href="http://anchetawern.github.io/blog/2013/11/03/gettting-started-with-coinbase-api/">get started with the Coinbase API</a> which is also another service which allows you to use Bitcoins as a means of payment for goods and services. This time we will be exploring Bitpay. But first lets determine what&rsquo;s the difference between the Coinbase and Bitpay. Here&rsquo;s a really good answer to <a href="http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/7544/what-are-the-differences-and-similarities-among-paymium-bitpay-coinbase-etc">this question</a>:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>BitPay is a payment processor for E-Commerce as well as for bricks and mortar / point-of-sale. This allows a business to accept bitcoins for payment and the proceeds are delivered to the merchant as directed. This could be 100% fiat (e.g., all bitcoin sales get converted to USDs immediately, or a mix, .. like 30% USD, 70% BTCs, etc.) The currently can send payments to merchants in U.S., Mexico, Canada and several nations in Europe.</p></blockquote></p>

<p><blockquote><p>Coinbase is an EWallet provider and provides a service for buying and selling bitcoins. They do not operate a market, but instead use the exchange rate from the leading exchange (Mt. Gox) for customer buying and selling. They charge just 1% to buy or sell, but they have low limits (i.e., buy a max of $100 USD per-day) for new customers still in the 30-day probationary period.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>So what service you use basically depends on what you need.</p>

<h3>Signing Up</h3>

<p>First you need to <a href="https://bitpay.com/start">sign up at Bitpay</a> in order to get an API key which you can use for interacting with their API. Bitpay is really strict when it comes to the registration so you really have to provide real information about your business so that you can actually confirm it when they need some confirmation.</p>

<h3>Connecting to Bitpay API</h3>

<p>The Bitpay API only requires basic HTTP authentication so the process of connecting to the API is really simple.
All you have to do is to call the <code>base64_encode()</code> method on the API key that you acquire from Bitpay and then pass it as one of the HTTP header fields. Under the <code>Authorization</code> field use <code>Basic</code> followed by the base 64 encoded string representation of the API key. Here&rsquo;s how to do it using <code>file_get_contents()</code>:</p>

<p>```php
&lt;?php
$user = base64_encode($api_key);</p>

<p>$context_options = array(</p>

<pre><code>"http" =&gt; array(
    "method" =&gt; $method,
    "header"  =&gt; "Content-type: application/json\r\n" . 
        "Content-Length: $length\r\n" .
        "Authorization: Basic $user\r\n"
)
</code></pre>

<p>);</p>

<p>$context = stream_context_create($context_options);</p>

<p>//the $url here is the API resource that you&rsquo;re trying to request from
$response = file_get_contents($url, false, $context);
$response = json_decode($response, true);
?>
```</p>

<h3>Creating an Invoice</h3>

<p>You can create an Invoice via by using the following resource in the Bitpay API:</p>

<p><code>
https://bitpay.com/api/invoice
</code></p>

<p>Then passing in all the fields required by the resource:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>price</strong> &ndash; the price of the service or good.</li>
<li><strong>currency</strong> &ndash; any valid currency short name (USD, GBP, EUR, JPY). Here&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.casi.org.uk/info/1051list/annexd.html">full list of valid currency short names</a>. This will be automatically converted to the corresponding value in Bitcoins (BTC) depending on the <a href="https://bitpay.com/bitcoin-exchange-rates">current Bitcoin exchange rates</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can also pass in some optional fields:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>posData</strong> &ndash; this is normally used for passing in some additional information regarding the service or good that a customer is trying to purchase</li>
<li><p><strong>notificationURL</strong> &ndash; the URL that will be pinged by Bitpay everytime the transaction status changes. Note that a change from <code>new</code> to <code>expired</code> doesn&rsquo;t count as a transaction status change. Bitpay will only ping the URL when the transaction status changes from <code>new</code> to <code>paid</code>, <code>confirmed</code>, or<code>complete</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>transactionSpeed</strong> &ndash; this can be set to <code>high</code>, <code>medium</code> or <code>low</code>. High means that the invoice is considered to be confirmed after a payment has been received. Medium means it will be considered confirmed after 10 minutes. And low means it will be considered confirmed after an hour.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>fullNotifications</strong> &ndash; this can be set to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. If you want Bitpay to notify via email or via the notification url that you have set every time the transaction status changes then use <code>true</code>. If you only want Bitpay to notify once the transaction status becomes confirmed then set to <code>false</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>notificationEmail</strong> &ndash; the email address that Bitpay will notify on every transaction status change.</p></li>
<li><strong>redirectURL</strong> &ndash; the URL in which Bitpay will display in the receipt after a payment has been made.</li>
</ul>


<p>And here are some fields which you can use to supply information regarding the product or the customer:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>orderID</strong></li>
<li><strong>itemDesc</strong></li>
<li><strong>itemCode</strong></li>
<li><strong>physical</strong></li>
<li><strong>buyerName</strong></li>
<li><strong>buyerAddress1</strong></li>
<li><strong>buyerAddress2</strong></li>
<li><strong>buyerCity</strong></li>
<li><strong>buyerState</strong></li>
<li><strong>buyerZip</strong></li>
<li><strong>buyerCountry</strong></li>
<li><strong>buyerEmail</strong></li>
<li><strong>buyerPhone</strong></li>
</ul>


<h3>Invoice Status</h3>

<p>The invoice status is the status of the invoice at any given time. Here are some of the invoice states:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>new</strong> &ndash; Initially the invoice status is <code>new</code>. This means that someone can still initiate a payment to the Bitcoin address that is associated with the invoice.</li>
<li><strong>paid</strong> &ndash; when an invoice becomes fully paid its status changes to <code>paid</code></li>
<li><strong>confirmed</strong> &ndash; an invoice is considered confirmed depending on the transaction speed that was set on the creation of invoice. If the transaction speed is set to low then it will be confirmed after an hour or 6 blocks in the Bitcoin network, if the transaction speed is set to medium then it will be confirmed after 1 block (10 minutes) in the Bitcoin network, if its set to high then it will be confirmed right after full payment has been made.</li>
<li><strong>complete</strong> &ndash; this means that Bitpay has credited the merchant&rsquo;s account for the invoice.</li>
<li><strong>expired</strong> &ndash; this means that no payment has been received after the 15 minute limit alloted by Bitpay.</li>
<li><strong>invalid</strong> &ndash; this means that the invoice has been paid but has not been confirmed after an hour.</li>
</ul>


<p>Now were ready to actually make a request to the Bitpay API. You can start by downloading the official <a href="https://github.com/bitpay/php-client">PHP client</a> provided by Bitpay for interacting with the Bitpay API. There&rsquo;s also a <a href="https://github.com/bitpay/ruby-client">Ruby</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bitpay/nodejs-client">Node.js</a> client if you&rsquo;re developing for those.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve downloaded it on your working directory open up the <code>bp_options.php</code> file and supply a value for the <code>apiKey</code>, <code>currency</code> or any of the optional fields that you would like to supply.</p>

<p>Create a new PHP file which we will be using to call the methods from <code>bp_lib.php</code>. To create an invoice call the <code>bpCreateInvoice()</code> method. It needs 4 arguments. The first one is the order ID which we will just supply <code>null</code> since we really don&rsquo;t have a system for generating order IDs. The second is the amount or the cost of the product or service.
The third is the optional post data in which we can provide additional information for the product or service in key-value pairs. The fourth is the additional options which is primarily used for supplying information regarding the product or the customer.</p>

<p>```
&lt;?php
require &lsquo;bp_lib.php&rsquo;;</p>

<p>$amount = 10;
$post_data = array(</p>

<pre><code>'name' =&gt; 'excalibur',
'level' =&gt; '999'
</code></pre>

<p>);
$addl_options = array(</p>

<pre><code>'itemDesc' =&gt; 'Anime Figurine'
</code></pre>

<p>);</p>

<p>$response = bpCreateInvoice(null, $amount, $post_data, $addl_options);                <br/>
if(!empty($response)){</p>

<pre><code>//do something
</code></pre>

<p>}
?>
```</p>

<p>Bitpay returns a response similar to the following:</p>

<p>```
Array
(</p>

<pre><code>[id] =&gt; xxx
[url] =&gt; https://bitpay.com/invoice?id=xxx
[posData] =&gt; {"posData":{"name":"excalibur","level":999},"hash":"xxxx-xx"}
[status] =&gt; new
[btcPrice] =&gt; 0.0009
[price] =&gt; 1
[currency] =&gt; USD
[invoiceTime] =&gt; 1385885490958
[expirationTime] =&gt; 1385886390958
[currentTime] =&gt; 1385885491133
</code></pre>

<p>)
```</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>id</strong> &ndash; the unique id of the invoice</li>
<li><strong>url</strong> &ndash; the URL in which the invoice can be viewed</li>
<li><strong>posData</strong> &ndash; the additional data that we provided earlier</li>
<li><strong>status</strong> &ndash; the invoice status</li>
<li><strong>btcPrice</strong> &ndash; the corresponding amount in Bitcoins of the amount supplied earlier</li>
<li><strong>price</strong> &ndash; the amount that was supplied earlier when the invoice was created</li>
<li><strong>currency</strong> &ndash; the currency of the price</li>
<li><strong>invoiceTime</strong> &ndash; the time the invoice was created since January 1, 1970 midnight. This is in a UNIX timestamp format.</li>
<li><strong>expirationTime</strong> &ndash; the time in which the invoice will expire. When the invoice expires payments can no longer be accepted.</li>
<li><strong>currentTime</strong> &ndash; the current time in the Bitpay server. This is primarily used for determining the time remaining before the invoice expires.</li>
</ul>


<p>Accessing the invoice URL will give you a page similar to the following:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/getting_started_with_bitpay/bitpay-donation.png" alt="invoice url" /></p>

<p>Customers can then use a Bitcoin client such as <a href="http://bitcoin.org/en/download">Bitcoin Qt</a>, <a href="http://electrum.org/">Electrum</a>, <a href="https://multibit.org/">Multibit</a>, or <a href="https://bitcoinarmory.com/">Armory</a> to pay you the merchant.</p>

<h3>Getting Invoice Status</h3>

<p>You can also get the status of an invoice by calling the <code>bpGetInvoice()</code> method and supplying the invoice ID as the argument:</p>

<p><code>php
&lt;?php
$invoice = bpGetInvoice('85AHEqCRaT2aZ3xAMpK8fQ');
?&gt;
</code></p>

<p>The method will return something like this:</p>

<p>```
Array
(</p>

<pre><code>[id] =&gt; xxx
[url] =&gt; https://bitpay.com/invoice?id=xxx
[posData] =&gt; Array
    (
        [name] =&gt; excalibur
        [age] =&gt; 27
    )

[status] =&gt; new
[btcPrice] =&gt; 0.0009
[price] =&gt; 1
[currency] =&gt; USD
[invoiceTime] =&gt; 1385885490958
[expirationTime] =&gt; 1385886390958
[currentTime] =&gt; 1385886420720
</code></pre>

<p>)
```</p>

<p>Its basically the same as the response that we get when creating an invoice.</p>

<h3>Bitpay Class</h3>

<p>Before I end this tutorial here&rsquo;s the modified version of the Bitpay client provided by Bitpay that works with servers without CURL support:</p>

<p>```php
&lt;?php
class Bitpay{</p>

<pre><code>private $options;

public function __construct($options){
    $this-&gt;options = $options;
}

public function bpLog($contents){
    $file = dirname(__FILE__).'/bplog.txt';
    file_put_contents($file, date('m-d H:i:s').": ", FILE_APPEND);

    if (is_array($contents))
        $contents = var_export($contents, true);    
    else if (is_object($contents))
        $contents = json_encode($contents);

    file_put_contents($file, $contents."\n", FILE_APPEND);          
}

public function bpfilegetcontents($url, $apiKey, $post = false) {
    global $bpOptions;  

    $length = 0;
    $method = "GET";
    if($post){  
        $length = strlen($post);
        $method = "POST";
    }

    $uname = base64_encode($apiKey);

    $context_options = array(
        "http" =&gt; array(
            "method" =&gt; $method,
            "header"  =&gt; "Content-type: application/json\r\n" . 
                "Content-Length: $length\r\n" .
                "Authorization: Basic $uname\r\n"
        )
    );      

    if($method == 'POST'){
        $context_options["http"]["content"] = $post;
    }

    $context = stream_context_create($context_options);
    $response = file_get_contents($url, false, $context);

        'posData', 'price', 'currency', 'physical', 'fullNotifications', 'transactionSpeed', 'buyerName', 
        'buyerAddress1', 'buyerAddress2', 'buyerCity', 'buyerState', 'buyerZip', 'buyerEmail', 'buyerPhone');
    foreach($postOptions as $o)
        if (array_key_exists($o, $options))
            $post[$o] = $options[$o];
    $post = json_encode($post);

    $response = $this-&gt;bpfilegetcontents('https://bitpay.com/api/invoice/', $options['apiKey'], $post);

    return $response;
}


public function bpVerifyNotification($apiKey = false) {

    if (!$apiKey)
        $apiKey = $this-&gt;options['apiKey'];

        return 'no posData';

    $posData = json_decode($json['posData'], true);
    if($this-&gt;options['verifyPos'] and $posData['hash'] != $this-&gt;bpHash(serialize($posData['posData']), $apiKey))
        return 'authentication failed (bad hash)';
    $json['posData'] = $posData['posData'];

    return $json;
}

public function bpGetInvoice($invoiceId, $apiKey = false) {

    if (!$apiKey)
        $apiKey = $this-&gt;options['apiKey'];     

    $response = $this-&gt;bpfilegetcontents('https://bitpay.com/api/invoice/'.$invoiceId, $apiKey);
    if (is_string($response))
        return $response; 
    $response['posData'] = json_decode($response['posData'], true);
    $response['posData'] = $response['posData']['posData'];

    return $response;   
}

public function bpHash($data, $key) {
    $hmac = base64_encode(hash_hmac('sha256', $data, $key, TRUE));
    return strtr($hmac, array('+' =&gt; '-', '/' =&gt; '_', '=' =&gt; ''));
}
</code></pre>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this article I&rsquo;ll be showing you how to get started developing applications which communicates with the Coinbase API. But first what is Coinbase?</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Coinbase is a service that allows you to use bitcoins as a means of payment for goods and services.<br/>Its like Paypal but for bitcoins.</p></blockquote></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First thing that you need to do is to register an account with Coinbase.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/coinbase_api/coinbase-register.png" alt="register account" /></p>

<p>Then go to your email and verify the account.</p>

<p>Accept the license.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/coinbase_api/coinbase-license.png" alt="accept license" /></p>

<p>Next, click on account settings and then click on the integrations tab:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/coinbase_api/coinbase-api.png" alt="integrations" /></p>

<p>Next, click on show my API key. You would need to enter your password to verify that you are indeed the account owner. Initially the API key is disabled so you need to enable it as well.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/coinbase_api/enable-apikey.png" alt="enable api key" /></p>

<p>After that, simply copy the API key that&rsquo;s displayed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/coinbase_api/copy-apikey.png" alt="copy api key" /></p>

<p>The API key will be used for authenticating requests to the Coinbase API.</p>

<h3>Authentication</h3>

<p>There are 2 ways in which a request to the API can be authenticated:</p>

<ol>
<li>API key</li>
<li>OAuth2</li>
</ol>


<h4>Authentication using API Key</h4>

<p>Authenticating a request via the API Key is the easier way of making requests to the API. All you have to do is to append the api key on each request. The cool thing is you can directly execute a request to the API directly from the browser for methods that can be called via <code>GET</code>.</p>

<p>For example when you want to get the account balance, you simply do something like:</p>

<p><code>
https://coinbase.com/api/v1/account/balance?api_key=xyz
</code></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a bunch of other methods which you can call directly from the browser. They&rsquo;re all listed <a href="https://coinbase.com/api/doc/1.0.html">here</a>. Do note that you can only call a method directly from the browser when its request method is <code>GET</code>. <code>POST</code> methods cannot be called directly from the browser, you need to use <code>curl</code> or <code>file_get_contents()</code> to be able to make the request.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of using <code>curl</code> to generate  a payment button, remember to pass the API Key along with the parameters required by the specific API method:</p>

<p>```php
&lt;?php</p>

<pre><code>$request = '{
    "api_key" : "xyz", 
    "button": {
        "name": "test",
        "price_string": "1.23",
        "price_currency_iso": "USD"
    }
}';

$post_fields = json_decode($request, true); //convert json string to an object
$post_fields = http_build_query($post_fields); //urlencode for arrays

$curl = curl_init();
curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_POST, true); //tell curl that were posting some data along with the request 
curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $post_fields); //the data that we want to post
curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_URL, 'https://coinbase.com/api/v1/buttons'); //the request url

curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true); //return the transfer, by default its being echoed out
$response = curl_exec($curl); //execute the request
</code></pre>

<p>?>
```</p>

<p>The method that we have used above is the <code>buttons</code> method. It only requires 3 arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>button[name]</strong> &ndash; the name of the item or service for which you are collecting bitcoins.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>button[price_string]</strong> &ndash; the total price of the item or service.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>button[price_currency_iso]</strong> &ndash; the currency of the price used in the <code>button[price_string]</code> argument. Examples are <code>USD</code>, <code>PHP</code>, <code>SGD</code>, <code>CAD</code>, or <code>BTC</code> for the bitcoin currency. It would be easier if <code>BTC</code> isn&rsquo;t used so you won&rsquo;t have to convert. Simply use your local currency and the API will automatically convert it to <code>BTC</code> depending on the current exchange rate.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The response would be formatted in JSON:</p>

<p>```json
{</p>

<pre><code>"success": true,
"button": {
    "code": "93865b9cae83706ae59220c013bc0afd",
    "type": "buy_now",
    "style": "buy_now_large",
    "text": "Pay With Bitcoin",
    "name": "test",
    "description": "Sample description",
    "custom": "Order123",
    "price": {
        "cents": 123,
        "currency_iso": "USD"
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>To generate the payment button, simply create a div with a class of <code>coinbase-button</code> then give it a data attribute <code>data-code</code> using the button code as its value. After that create a new script element and use the <code>button.js</code> from coinbase:</p>

<p>```html</p>

<div class="coinbase-button" data-code="<?php echo $response->button->code; ?>"></div>


<script src="https://coinbase.com/assets/button.js"></script>


<p>```</p>

<p>The response returned above can also be used for generating payment pages.
All you have to do is append the button code to the coinbase checkout url:</p>

<p><code>html
&lt;?php
$response = json_decode($response); //convert json string to an object
?&gt;
&lt;a href="https://coinbase.com/checkouts/&lt;?php echo $response-&gt;button-&gt;code; ?&gt;"&gt;Checkout&lt;/a&gt;
</code></p>

<h4>Authentication using OAuth2</h4>

<p>Authentication using OAuth2 is a bit difficult. Thankfully there are good people out there who creates libraries that makes our lives easier. One of those libraries is the <a href="https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-php">Coinbase-PHP</a> library.</p>

<p>To use it, simply download the zip file from the Github repository or clone it on your machine. Once the download is done, you can just include it on your working script:</p>

<p><code>php
&lt;?php
require 'libs/coinbase/Coinbase.php';
?&gt;
</code></p>

<p>After that, you can go ahead and call the methods available from the library. In the example below were calling the <code>getOrders()</code> method which simply returns all the orders received by the merchant who owns the API Key that is used in the code. This means that every merchant who plans to integrate Coinbase in their application has to create their own Coinbase app in order to receive an API Key. The API Key will then serve as their identification for each request that is made to the API. Yes this is a bit of a drag for the merchants but that&rsquo;s just how it works so there&rsquo;s no choice but to stick with it.</p>

<p><code>
&lt;?php
$api_key = 'xyz';
$coinbase = new Coinbase($api_key);
$orders = $coinbase-&gt;getOrders();
?&gt;
</code></p>

<p>The response returned from the code above is not the same as the response that you directly get from the API.
The library already converts it to an object so there&rsquo;s no need to. Here&rsquo;s an example of looping through the orders:</p>

<p>```
&lt;?php
if($orders->total_count > 0){</p>

<pre><code>foreach($orders-&gt;orders as $row){

    echo $row-&gt;order-&gt;created_at;
