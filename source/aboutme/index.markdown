Hi! I'm Wern Ancheta. I'm a  Web Developer from San Fernando City, La Union, Philippines.
I love building things for the web and sharing the things that I've learned through writing. 
When I'm not coding or learning something new, I enjoy watching anime and playing video games.


###Services Offered

Here are some of the services that I normally offer:

- **Web Development** - mainly PHP and its Frameworks (CodeIgniter, Laravel, Flight).
- **System Analysis and Design** - from requirements analysis, database design, to system architecture design.

Note that this is what I do most of the time. But I also work with JavaScript (NodeJS), Ruby, and Wordpress projects from time to time.
