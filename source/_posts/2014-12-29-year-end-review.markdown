This has been a very good and productive year. Lots of articles written, podcasts listened to, articles and books read, company and client projects, side-projects, travels, video games played, anime series and movies, video tutorials and talks watched. In this blog post I'll try to recollect some of those. 

###Articles Written

I'm not going to list out every article I've written on this blog for this year. We have the [archives](http://wern-ancheta.com/blog/archives/) for that. So here are the articles that I consider the best from 2014. These are based from the number of responses I got from both the commenting system and social media:

###Podcasts Listened To



###Articles Read

There's a gazillion of them. To give you an idea how much I articles I've read this year, here's a screenshot of session buddy, a chrome extension that I'm using for saving sets of tabs.

###Books Read

Ok I was kidding when I said I read lots of books this year. Actually I finished one. That is [Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555). I tend to read 2 to 3 books at a time, so I'm halfway through [This Will Make You Smarter: New Scientific Concepts to Improve Your Thinking by John Brockman](http://www.amazon.com/This-Will-Make-You-Smarter/dp/0062109391). And recently I've started reading [Optimism Bias by Tali Sharot](http://www.amazon.com/Optimism-Bias-Irrationally-Positive-Brain/dp/0307473511). 


###Company and Client Projects

I'm really thankful for having a great boss who always gives me some nice and cool projects to work on. This year I worked on a total of 7 company projects. 1 of those was from the previous company that I worked for. I joined my current company in late March this year so there's that 1 leftover project. Here are some of the company projects that I'm most proud of:

- [WP-Donations](http://wern-ancheta.com/projects/wpdonations)
- [Vmonial](http://wern-ancheta.com/projects/vmonial)
- [Blink](http://wern-ancheta.com/projects/blink)
- [StockSwitch](http://wern-ancheta.com/projects/stockswitch)
- [StockSwitch Mobile](http://wern-ancheta.com/projects/stockswitch-mobile)

As for the client project, I don't actively look for them and even if I get one, I usually reject it because of lack of experience on the technologies to be used and overall lack of interest. There's only one project that got through the tight screening, and that is the [ebay store automator](http://wern-ancheta.com/projects/esa/).


###Side-projects

There's an abundance of side-projects this year. I usually do these projects to automate some of the tasks that I usually do by hand, or to get my hands dirty on a specific technology I've never worked with before. Here are some of those:

- [octo-views](https://github.com/anchetaWern/octo-views)
- [octo-iframe](https://github.com/anchetaWern/octo-iframe)
- [laravel bootstrap starter](https://github.com/anchetaWern/laravel-bootstrap-starter)
- [octo-wysiwyg](https://github.com/anchetaWern/octo-wysiwyg)
- [jekyll-contact](https://github.com/anchetaWern/jekyll-contact)
- [Ahead](https://github.com/anchetaWern/ahead)
- [Antares](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wern.antares)


###Travels

I recently got a car so I naturally got exposed more exposure to the outside world as an excuse for getting some driving experience. Here are some of the places I've been to this year. I've mostly visited towns inside the same province where I live:

- Botanical Garden, San Fernando City, La Union
- Intake Dam, Sudipen, La Union
- Bahay na Bato, Luna, La Union
- Occalong Falls, Luna, La Union
- Callao Caves, Penablanca, Cagayan
- Aparri, Cagayan
- Basilica Minore of Our Lady of Piat, Piat, Cagayan
- Baluarte, Vigan City, Ilocos Sur
- Pindangan Ruins, San Fernando City, La Union
- Pugo Adventure, Pugo, La Union
- Basilica Minore of Our Lady of Charity, Agoo, La Union
- Namacpacan Church, Luna, La Union
- Balay Anito Falls, Santol, La Union

###Video Games

Not really a lot. I just played a bunch of Pokemon on my Nintendo DS Lite. These days I barely even touch it since I've already finished all the Pokemon games available for DS. That's why I'm planning on selling it to buy the 3DS which apparently have some pretty badass Pokemon Games in Full 3D.

###Anime Series

I'm a big anime fan, and I'm probably watching more than what I should be watching. At most around 40 anime series per year. But here are the only ones that I can recommend:

- Parasyte
- Hamatora
- Haikyu
- Amagi Brilliant Park
- Hunter x Hunter (2011 Remake)
- Free!
- Noragami
- Terra Formars
- Nanatsu no Taizai
- Yowamushi Pedal
- Tokyo Ghoul
- Shingeki no Bahamut
- Garo: The Animation
- Terror in Resonance
- Captain Earth
- Log Horizon
- Sword Art Online (Season 2)
- Chunibyo
- Chaika - The Coffin Princess
- World Trigger
- Barakamon
- Brynhildr in the Darkness
- Kagerou Project
- Psycho Pass (Season 2)
- Aldnoah.Zero
- Akatsuki no Yona
- Akame Ga Kill


###Movies

Lots of good movies this year but here's the best:

- Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
- Captain America: Winter Soldier
- X-men: Days of Future Past
- Lucy
- Divergent
- Cloverfield


###Talks

I don't really go to conferences so I only watched talks from all over the world via Youtube. I've watched a lot of them this year but I'll only pick this one talk: 

- [Our Web Development Workflow is Completely Broken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctwEcZC_mmI).
