I'm a terrible programmer. 

**I'm terrible at naming things**. Sometimes I end up with a very long method name like ```getAllAwesomePeopleInTheTwitterVerse()```. 
Or a very short variable like ```$i```.

**I don't always follow best practices**. 
Yes I know a lot of best practices but I only implement a few of them.
Either because of lack of time to see for myself if its indeed a good practice or just plain laziness.

**I do not optimize my code**. 
And what I mean by this is that I haven't used profiling tools on my projects
to see if its actually speedy.

**I do not use caching**. Queries runs all the time even if there are no changes in the database. I'm thinking that not caching the data will not actually affect the performance if there's only a small group of people using the application. 

**I do not refactor my code all the time**. 
Sometimes I end up repeating the logic a few times and then I'll get lazy
and not improve the code.

**I use frameworks, libraries and plugins all the time**. 
I haven't tried implementing MVC on my own. I use Frameworks like CodeIgniter, CakePHP, Zend, Yii, and Laravel to do things for me.
I use jQuery to manipulate the dom and make the elements dance, sing and fly in the air but I have difficulty implementing it using plain JavaScript.
I always search on Google for the functionality that I need because there may be already a jQuery plugin written for that. Then I'll just hack through the code and modify the stylesheet files if I have to customize something.

**I suck at JavaScript**. Yes jQuery is JavaScript and I believe I'm good at jQuery but it doesn't necessarily make me a JavaScript developer. 
And because of this dependence to jQuery I end up with shitty smelly code full of event delegation and variables polluting the global namespace.
Thankfully I discovered some MV* Frameworks that will hopefully help me with this
shitty client side code problem.
Writing cross-browser JavaScript code is not quite my level yet.

**I'm terrible at implementing coding standards**. 
Sometimes I name my variables like ```$firstname```, sometimes I end up doing
```$last_name``` for the others. One of these days I'll try to research on a tool that can implement coding standards for me. Or at least a text-editor plugin
that will shout at me if it sees anything inconsistent in my code.

**I also want to learn a lot**. To the point where I don't know what to learn next anymore. And once I started learning something I couldn't really get to the deeper parts because then I will be interested in learning another thing again.  

**I don't do Test Driven Development**. Yes I've wrote a [tutorial about it](http://anchetawern.github.com/blog/2012/12/17/getting-started-with-unit-testing-in-php/) and explored some of the basics like assertions, data providers and dependencies but it stopped there. I've never actually implemented TDD in a project.

**I don't do automated testing**. Yes I've heard of Selenium, Sahi and other automated testing tools but I haven't actually tried them.

**I do not use tools** that will make my life easier. Things like yeoman, grunt and bower, IDE with all the shiny new guns and swords.

**I do not always ask others** (programmers, developers, ninjas, zombies, robots) opinion on something.

**I do not constantly think of the code that I'm writing**. Sometimes I just copy and paste
thing here and there. I name variables and methods poorly. And I end up with spaghetti code.

**I'm having difficulty planning how should I code things**. Something like having a clear picture on how to go about things. Yes I use mockup builders and I write things (system flow, psuedo code) down on paper but I cannot seem to have a clear picture of how to organize my code so that I will need lesser refactoring later on.

Those are the things that makes me believe that I'm a terrible programmer. 
But I'm working on it each day.
