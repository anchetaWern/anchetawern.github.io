###13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina display

I have always wanted a Macbook Pro since birth. But due to its priciness I never got myself to buy one.

I'd like to stick with the following hardware:

- **Processor**: 3.0GHz Dual-core Intel Core i7
- **Memory**: 8GB 1600MHz DDR3L SDRAM
- **Storage**: 512GB PCIe-based Flash Storage

###Google Nexus 5

Not really a Google fanboy, I'm just more curious about a smartphone made by Google rather than an Apple's iPhone or Samsung's Galaxy. 

###PS Vita

I've always been a fan of game consoles from Sony and their games are really good. Here are just some of the titles that I've enjoyed playing on their PSP game console:

- Patapon - that's Patapon 1, 2 and 3
- God Eater
- Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core
- Harvest Moon - boy & girl, innocent life and hero of the leaf valley
- Ratchet and Clank
- Naruto Ultimate Ninja Heroes - that's 1, 2 and 3
- GTA: Vice City
- Ratchet and Clank
- Secret Agent Clank
- Valhalla Knights

###Nintendo 3ds

To be honest I only really want this game console because of Pokemon. Nintendo 3ds have revolutionize the Pokemon gameplay in this console. There's a bunch of new stuff, and the best thing is that its 3D. So the Pokemon games created for this console won't really look like the Pokemon games created for Nintendo DS or Gameboy.

###Fitbit Flex

Fitbit is an all-in-one tracker for the body. With it you can do the following:

- track steps, distance and calories burned
- monitor how long and well you sleep
- silent wake alarm
- logs food consumption, weight changes

###Bose QuietComfort 25

I've always wanted a noise cancelling headphones that I can use while working. Based on my research Bose is the best thing out there.

###Olympus ME-52W Noise Canceling Microphone

Screencasting has always been on my TODO list. As a developer I wanted to create a Youtube Channel where I record screencasts of things I've learned. The only thing that's stopping me is the not-so-quality sound recorder that comes with my laptop.

###Seagate Backup Plus 5TB Desktop External Hard Drive

Last thing on this list is this 5TB External Hard Drive from Seagate. I download a lot of stuff from the internet to prepare for events where there is no internet and I have nothing to do on my computer.
