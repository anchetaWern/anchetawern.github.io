Heck there's a lot! The list is endless and it's hard to keep up. 
There's always something new everyday. 
There's always a new technology, methodology, library, and tool.
There's always a new blog post, video, and podcasts that speaks about these technologies, methodologies, libraries and tools.
There's always a new, cool and faster way to solve problems.

There's always this temptation (in most cases obsession) to check out all the shiny and new stuff, to read all those blog posts which speaks about them.
And before you know it there's no more time left for you to solve the real problems that needs solving.

Most of the tools, libraries and methodologies that comes out everyday is yet another way to solve existing problems.
The only difference is that its newer and it looks sexier. But sooner or later it becomes out of fashion and a shiny new thing will replace it again. 

What's important is learning the core technology behind a library, so instead of learning jQuery, Mootools or Dojo we should first learn JavaScript. Instead of learning how to use Bootstrap or Foundation we should learn the basics and important concepts in CSS first. Core technologies that makes the whole platform (the web) work  never gets replaced thus it should be given the priority before the shiny and new stuff. And once your done learning the core technologies you're in a good position to try out some of the shiny and new stuff. And by try I mean giving it a go for a week or so and see if it feels right for you. If it feels right for you and you think it makes you more productive then you should definitely include it in your daily workflow.

Who cares if you're using MS Paint and not Photoshop. Who cares if you're using Notepad or Dreamweaver instead of Sublime Text. Who cares if you're still using `alert` instead of `console.log` to debug your JavaScript. If you think you're productive by using some of the old tools then why not right? At the end of the day it doesn't really matter what tools, libraries or methodologies we use as long as we get to solve problems and we make our clients happy by solving them.
