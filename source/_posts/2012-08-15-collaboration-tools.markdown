Here are some of the collaboration tools/project management tools that I recently came accross with.

###Trello
This is the only one that I can recommend because I've already used this before when my group mates and I were working on our Thesis.
All I can say is that it lived up to its tagline "Your entire project, in a single glance". This is a very good tool for visual thinkers.
Each task is represented by a card and you can group each card into lists. You can select the people who are going to work on each card, set deadlines, and archive them once they're done.
