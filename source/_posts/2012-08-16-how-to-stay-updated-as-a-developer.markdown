As developers we have to always stay up to date with the latest technology for us to better make informed choices in what specific methodology or technology
we can use for our jobs. Staying up to date means that we can be more efficient in doing our jobs. It doesn't mean that new technologies are better but they usually are
since they are usually created to make our lives better.
If you need more reasons on why you need to stay updated I asked a [question at programmers.stackexchange.com](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/161099/why-do-developers-need-to-keep-up-to-date-with-technologies-and-methodologies) 
specifically for that. Here are some of the answers given by the awesome programmers in the community:


{% blockquote Anonymous %}
New technologies surface for a reason. Usually that reason is because they are more efficient or powerful at accomplishing a particular task.

There is still value to be had in sticking with old technology for the sake of legacy systems, but when they eventually reach their end of life you'll be behind the game.

Business reasons aside, constantly learning new technologies keeps you on your toes and will open your eyes to different ways of approaching tasks, even in old technologies and so on, so forth.
{% endblockquote %}

{% blockquote Dasblinkenlight %}
Learning new things very often help you see the things that you already know from a different perspective, in the same way that learning a new language helps you learn more things about your current language.
{% endblockquote %}


And here's a bit of advice from Telastyn:

{% blockquote telastyn %}
Trying to learn everything new all the time is going to lead you to be poor at many things, perceived as a flighty tinkerer. Learn a few things well, and focus at least on knowing what exists, even if you can't use it effectively.
{% endblockquote %}

Anyway, enough with the reasons let's jump in to the main topic of this article. Here are some of the resources that can help you stay updated. Feel free to add some more in the comments, thanks!
